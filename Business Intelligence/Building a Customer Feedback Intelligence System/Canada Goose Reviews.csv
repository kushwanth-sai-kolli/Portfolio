If you buy a product and something happens with the item, they will not help you to find a solution or provide you with any kind of service. I would never recommend anyone buying anything from this brand. I have never experienced worse service","January 25, 2025"
"Justin Cooke","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","My family and I have bought and worn Canada Goose our entire lives. We did so because of the quality of their product. However, despite their promise that ""Every Canada Goose purchase is fully warranted for the lifetime of the product"" Canada Goose failed to repair one of my jackets, returning it to me with a broken zip. It is so sad to see a brand lose everything it stood for and a multi-generational customer in exchange for short term shareholder value. What is worse are the stock copy and paste platitudes provided by their customer services team as evident by their reply below.","April 09, 2025"
"Nicole","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I was so excited to have a Canada Goose coat and after much research purchased a Shelburne Parka. It was very expensive but given the lifetime warranty, I felt this was a coat I would have forever. I only wore this coat in extreme cold weather, maybe 10 times a year. I have had the coat for a little over 5 years and it has small holes along the entire length of the seams of both sleeves, on the cuffs and in other areas of the sleeves. The material is such poor quality that it is literally ripping away from the stitching. I have never had a coat do this before. I thought it wouldn’t be a huge issue because of the lifetime warranty. This is clearly a manufacturing defect. I submitted a warranty claim and was told that they will repair the sleeves with “zigzag stitching that will hardly be noticeable.” When you spend $2000 on a coat, the last thing you want is zigzag stitching down both sleeves. I requested a re-inspection but was told this was the only option. I either live with a coat with tears in the sleeves or have noticeable zigzag stitching all along the sleeves. I am so incredibly disappointed in the customer service. Save your money and buy a product whose company stands behind their work and warranty.","April 03, 2025"
"Hayley","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Case Number: 00888876I spent £1,000 on a Canada Goose coat, believing it came with a lifetime warranty, only to be told that a minor tear was an “accidental tear” and therefore not covered. What’s even more frustrating is that they won’t offer any repair service—paid or otherwise. Instead, they are simply sending the coat back in the same damaged condition.For a company charging thousands of pounds for their products, it’s shocking that they refuse to provide basic repair options. Customer service has been painfully slow, despite the jacket arriving at their warehouse quickly.This whole experience has been frustrating and completely unacceptable for a so-called premium brand. I won’t be buying from Canada Goose again and certainly won’t be recommending them.","April 02, 2025"
"Enzo","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Excessively poor quality and terrible customer service.My McMillan Parka had excessive pilling on the cuffs after wearing it less than 10 times. Also numerous stiches started to fail.I sent the Parka to be repaired but according to their ""QA Experts"" this was judged as normal wear. I could not beleive my eyes when I read the customer service email. A 1200€ jacket in such a terrible state after wearing it less than 10 days. This has never happened to any jacket I ever wore, even extremely cheap ones.Stay away from this brand, the quality is absolutely terrible and the customer service will not take any accountability of it.","March 31, 2025"

Please don’t reply saying our warranty team have conducted an inspection, as you say this to every review , Canada goose is a joke . Moncler kill you stone dead as they listen and don’t just fob you off with poor feable excusesWhat a surprise the expected reply so why ask me to send it back and then tell me it was never covered in the first place .

"Kylie Mccafferty","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I am extremely disappointed with Canada Goose’s warranty process and customer service. I sent in **two items** under their **""lifetime warranty""**, both of which had quality issues, including stitching defects and down that wouldn’t hold loft. After weeks of chasing for updates, I was finally told that both items **only needed dry cleaning**, and I was **charged for this**, despite it being presented as a ""repair.""  This is completely unacceptable for a so-called premium brand. Instead of addressing the **actual quality issues**, Canada Goose **charges customers for dry cleaning and calls it a repair**—no additional fixes, no replacement down, just cleaning. If I had known that the down would **flatten so quickly** and require expensive professional dry cleaning to restore it, I would never have purchased these products.  On top of this, their customer service is **completely unresponsive**—I’ve sent multiple emails and had to **chase every single update**. For the price Canada Goose charges, I expected far better aftercare. **Their ""lifetime warranty"" is misleading, and their support team does not take customer concerns seriously.**  I will be escalating this matter further. **If you’re considering Canada Goose, be aware that their warranty does not cover what you might expect, and you could be charged for basic maintenance while being left with unresolved quality issues.","February 19, 2025"
"Ariana Fitzpatrick","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Canada Goose won't accept my return because there is a small snag on the inside of the coat; a snag I didn't cause and must have been there when I received it. When I received the coat I tried it on and it didn't fit so I put it back in the box to make the return. I've been working with Canada Goose to try and get them to understand it must have been damaged before I received it but they are unwilling to listen to me and just keep claiming since it's damaged as there's no way a quick try on could have caused the issue but they won't accept the return, basically just keeping my money and leaving me with a product that I can't wear because it doesn't fit and out over $1,000 (nothing to them but quit a bit to me). What's further frustrating is that you can return damaged items if you notice they are damaged with you receive them, so had i just thoroughly inspected the coat when received instead of just the quick try on, I could have sent it back as damaged and wouldn't be in this mess. However, since I didn't do that, in bring accused of causing damage instead of the mindless drones of Canada Goose customer service actually using their brains of other possibilities (IE. That I received it in that condition). This is my first experience purchasing from Canada Goose and I will never do so again. The customer service team has been so rude; it's been a nightmare.","February 08, 2025"

"Leona Ribeiro","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I bought the Canada Goose Paradigm Expedition Parka Black Label for €2,000, expecting top-tier warmth and wind resistance, as advertised for temperatures as low as -30°C. Instead, I can feel the wind at just 10°C. The jacket is supposed to be wind-resistant, yet air cuts right through it.Even worse, when I’m in the car and rest my arm on the armrest, I can feel the cold seeping through the sleeve—proof that the so-called 750-fill power down is more air than insulation. The sleeves feel empty, like they’re barely filled with anything substantial.For the price, I expected real protection against the cold, not just a fancy logo and marketing hype. If you’re looking for a truly warm winter coat, look elsewhere—this one is all style, no function.1/5 stars. Not worth the money.","March 11, 2025"

"Daniel Kim","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I've always been a bigger fan of Canada Goose than Moncler and own several of their products. I've shopped both online and in-store and have always had good interactions with their team. However, my most recent online purchase was a nightmare due to their policies and customer service.I ordered two jackets in different sizes, intending to keep the one that fit best. When the package arrived, I took both jackets out, tried them on, and within five minutes, I put the one that didn’t fit back into the box, taped it up, and processed the return.A few weeks later, I noticed my refund hadn’t been posted, which was unusual since Canada Goose had always been quick with refunds in the past. When I reached out to their customer service team, I was shocked to learn that the item was being sent back to me. They refused the refund because they claimed the jacket had a hole in it—and since I had selected ""sizing"" as the reason for my return instead of ""damaged,"" they said I was responsible.First, if I’m spending over $1,000 on an item, the last thing I’m doing is inspecting it for quality control—that's Canada Goose’s job, not mine. Second, why would I intentionally damage a jacket that I planned to return, especially when I was buying two of the same item in different sizes? Lastly, even if I did have bad intentions (which I didn’t), wouldn’t I have claimed the item was ""damaged"" rather than selecting ""sizing"" as the reason for return? The jacket was out of the box for five minutes—there’s no way I caused the damage.I love their products, but they just lost a customer. Their policies make no sense, and their customer service team clearly needs better training. Not every case is the same, and they need to use more common sense when handling returns.Warning: If you're buying online, inspect your product immediately—even if you're just trying it on—because if you return it and they claim it’s damaged, you’ll be stuck footing the bill. It’s like walking into a fitting room, trying something on, and then being charged for damage they can’t prove wasn’t already there.Canada Goose, do better. Your policies make no sense.","February 28, 2025"

If this silly requirement truly does ""void the warranty,"" I will choose a different Company to purchase the two down parkas I was considering from Canada Goose.UPDATE:Based on the reply from Canada Goose, I have decided to spend $3500.00 on a competitive product.  This silly policy of “needing all tags” is completely unacceptable.  All the tags with exception of one are in the garment.

"Lily","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Horrible customer service and definitely not worth the price! I bought my mom a jacket as a present. Sadly, it didn’t fit her so I wanted to exchange it to get her a bigger size. I later found out Canada goose doesnt do exchanges; so in order to get a bigger size you have to return it, get the money back, and buy the right size (so I returned it). They DECLINED my return because it showed signs of “wear” but when I received photos as evidence, they don’t clearly show anything. It was never worn because it didn't fit! I was never notified that my return was being sent back to me until I reached out 3 weeks later when I didn’t see the money come back. The jacket could’ve easily been stolen sitting out for three weeks in the mail room. A $1500 jacket mind you. Opening the box they have left me with no original box, no hanger, jacket cover and certification of authenticity so I can’t even sell it…They dont care about you, they care about the money! Especially given the size and reputation of the company, I was expecting better. Never doing business with them again. Edit : So I guess “trying on the jacket I paid for” was too much for Canada Goose. Literally, jacket didnt fit so how could she have worn it? The jacket never left the house. They sent back the jacket in a clear bag with no original anything and also NEVER TOLD ME they were sending it back? Three weeks of no response. They clearly do not care about their customers. I will still fight for the Original Box, Hanger, Jacket Cover and print of authentication.Reading more reviews and it looks like im not the only one with a similar problem.","February 25, 2025"

"Jan Fairweather","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-3.svg","I recently purchased a Canada Goose Shelburne parka coat, expecting it to provide the warmth and comfort that the brand is known for. According to the instructions, the coat can withstand temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius. However, I have been feeling cold while wearing this coat, especially around my back and arms, even when the temperature here in New Jersey is 30 degrees. I have had to wear an extra layer under the coat to alleviate the cold.Given the high price of $1500, I expected the coat to perform better, especially when compared to less expensive coats that provide more warmth. It seems like the company prioritizes profit over customer satisfaction, which is disappointing. I had high expectations for this brand, and I believe it should live up to its promises.","January 20, 2025"
"Rita Santos","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I genuinely cannot express how utterly disappointed I am with Canada Goose and their customer service. I sent back a nearly new hat due to a defect in the stitching – a thread had come undone, which began to form a hole. However, after a week of waiting for an evaluation, their team concluded that it was ""accidental damage"" and refused to repair or replace it.The baffling part is that no one from Canada Goose took the time to properly assess the issue or even ask for more details. The hat is essentially brand new, used only a couple of times, and there's no sign of wear or tear—just a single thread that came undone. There were no broken threads, no marks, or any other form of damage to indicate it was mishandled. Yet, their response was to blame it on “accidental damage” without any explanation or transparency in how this was determined.I’ve since discovered that many others have had similar experiences, which just reinforces my belief that Canada Goose is more focused on its image and profits than actually providing a decent level of customer service or standing behind its supposed ""lifetime guarantee."" Now, I’m left with a faulty hat that’s heading for the bin, and it’s clear that they’ve lost yet another customer in the process.In contrast, other brands like Arc'teryx, Patagonia, North Face, and Moncler consistently prioritise their customers, offering great service and even supporting sustainability initiatives. Patagonia, in particular, even goes so far as to repair older products to reduce waste. This is the kind of ethos I want to support moving forward, and it’s a stark reminder of what Canada Goose is clearly lacking.It’s safe to say I won’t be trusting or supporting Canada Goose again, and I’d encourage others to look for brands that genuinely value their customers and uphold their promises.","January 20, 2025"

The coat barely even ‘saw the sunlight!!!Yes it was warm; the only salvation.The Canada Goose company couldn’t give any indication whatsoever; of what they could do (if anything) for me!!!!I was supposed to just do without it at the beginning of the impending winter, pay to return, pay to clean… on a song and a prayer they would even do anything for me!Then this year I looked down at my cuffs and was horrified to see they were becoming unraveled…like wtaf😳I didn’t even want to wear it!I created an account (which you are forced to do), and sent them pictures.They have a clause called “normal wear and tear” that may exclude them taking any responsibility, they tell me!!!!!!I ask again, can I at least bring it to your store, or can I drive it to the place I would have to pay to courier it?No.Wow, so I elected to pay my trusted seamstress to put two new cuffs on it for $45.00; hence, only being without the coat for two days. As well, I didn’t have to search for a box and pay for shipping, nor pay for a cleaning it didn’t even require🤬Of note:I have a 25 year old Zellers coat with the same type of cuffs, which has been worn a lot more than my Canada Goose Parka; and it’s cuffs remain immaculate to this day.Anyone contemplating purchasing a Canada Goose product, needs to know their warranty is literally a complete sham.🤥","November 30, 2024"
"Hannes","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I bought a jacket a few years ago and was very happy with it until I wore a dark cashmere sweater underneath it for the first time and looked like a plucked chicken. I then sent the jacket in the following summer, but according to the customer service department, no excessive loss of downs could be detected and the jacket was sent back to me. Now I tried it again and sent in the jacket via the store so that the employee on site could see the loss of down. He agreed to my opinion and sent in the jacket, but Canada Goose again refused to see the loss of down. A further complaint and an escalation to Quality Assurance in Canada did nothing and the jacket was sent back to me. The staff at the Munich store then stood up for me, but again no result, although they tried every possible way.I would really like to upload a photo but that's not possible so I put the photo in mit profile picture, small but maybe you will be able to see for yourself the excessive loss of down when you zoom in (as you can see, taken by an employee in the Canada Goose store in Munich).Last answer to the employees in the Munich store was, that this kind of down seepage is not excessive after some years. They must have forgotten about the requests the years before and they must have a totally different understanding of a non excessive down seepage as the Munich store employees and me, I guess. 2 things annoy me the most. On the one hand, the poor quality of the jacket at this price and on the other hand, that the promise of a lifetime guarantee is not kept.","January 20, 2025"
"NP","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Terrible quality, awful customer services, and laughable warranty. Well, they just lost a customer. Do they care? Of course they don't. Probably a good thing because I normally purchase a Canada Goose coat for my wife and I each Christmas, so, am looking forward to seeing what other brands have to offer.My issue - it's simple. My Wascana Rain Jacket developed a hole in the pocket after very light use (we are talking I have worn this jacket probably ten times). So, after raising a warranty claim, and waiting 3 months, I was able to send the jacket for repair under the lifetime warranty. But no, Canada Goose replied with the following:'The jacket has been shrunk, likely due to improper cleaning. Additionally, the abrasion damage to the baker at the lower left pocket has caused delamination.' and...'These concerns fall under negligence...'Amazingly, it has been shrunk! Must be the rain that has done that, because the jacket has never been washed. And it's nice of them to remind me of the fault (i.e. the hole in the pocket). It's obvious that this is a faulty jacket, and the stitching has failed.. So, I have the jacket back, with a wonderful hole in the pocket.If I was interested in wasting more of my time, I would reply to Canada Goose claiming that the jacket was clearly faulty. As a solicitor, I assess the likelihood of claiming this would be approximately 60/40 in my favor. But I do not wish to waste my time as I will earn far more by just driving my businesses, so I am happy to cut my losses and pass on the good news to my friends and family to avoid this brand, as the quality and customer services simply don't match their price tag.Glad I didn't take one of my other coats with me to Iceland when I went last month!

They have commented below to say the gloves had been worn, smell and tags removed well they weren’t and the item you have now sent me back is not the item we sent in. We actually thought paying the big money for a brand we would have a level of customer service, this is the worst I have ever had so far, the lack of quality communications, the lack of understanding of the issue, the carelessness of the process and to cap all this off the manner in which they reply shows they have zero care for their customers.To round this off I do not accept the pathetic excuse below. I want this matter escalated and I will be sure to make sure this review and process is documented across all social media channels as this is sickening behaviour.Sending me the paper work of another order would also been seen as a data leak.

Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are all part of the UK. If you use Royal Mail it’s the same Price anywhere in the UK and no customs at all.So I have told Canada Goose Regent St that I will buy it from them and that I will arrange for Royal Mail to collect it from their store.I never heard back from them again, so I emailed the CEO and offered the same.I never received a reply.So you know how poor Canada Goose customer service is when it’s poor from the top down.I’ve never heard of the CEOs office of any company refuse to reply to a customer and I’ve never heard of a company declining to make a sale for £1750.Appalling service from the CEO down.As you can see from the Canada Goose reply they have zero knowledge of geography and didn’t read my review.Point 1. Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales make up the UK.  Posting from any one of these to any of the other is not international shipping.  Posting from Ireland to Northern Ireland does constitute international shipping so they could not deliver it.  Your London store could.Point 2.  I stated that I would arrange shipping with Royal Mail to collect the item from your London store and deliver it to me.  This is the same price for Northern Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland because they are all in the UK and do not require international shipping. So Canada Goose would only have to take payment and have a parcel ready for collection by Royal Mail.I still have been ghosted by Canada Goose London and the CEOs office.I ended up buying a Stirling Shearling parka from Moose Knuckles.I bought it from their store in England and they shipped it to me in Northern Ireland in 24hrs with no customs fees.DO NOT BUY Canada goose.

Literally nothing in in the box, not even a delivery note. I even took a video of me opening it because it was so light that I knew there was a problem before I even opened it. That was three weeks ago. I logged the issue with CG customer service who asked for photos and my video which I sent immediately. Since then I have had nothing back from them despite two follow-ups from me. Calling their customer support staff ambassadors is a bad joke. I wouldn't expect such bad service even for a volume brand, let alone a premium brand such as CG. So I find myself £450 out of pocket and still no response - shockingly bad in every way. Update (17/1/25) Another long and fruitless call with a ""brand ambassador"". I insisted on a refund but was told that this was not possible as the investigation into what happened to my missing item was ongoing (3 weeks after the delivery of an empty box). I was categorically assured that I would get a call back within 48 hours but, of course, nothing. Staggering!Final update 29 Jan - a month since the initial issue.

"Brittany F","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Very disappointed. I have been an avid customer for years. I found a jacket that I adored. I ordered it in a few different sizes and had to return 3 of them for poor quality issues. I was just trying to find a new, unused jacket that fit properly. One arrived with a small hole, one was incredibly dirty, (I created a return before I took it out of the box) and one was discoloured. I kept trying because I like the jacket style. I contacted CG about the quality issues and my disappointment. This complaint is specific to the dirty jacket. I created a return for the jacket that was sent to me used and dirty within an hour of seeing it. I didn’t even take it out of the box when I saw the zipper pull was dark blue with what looked like Jean dye. I had the jacket in my possession a total of 2 hours before taping it back up to send back. I listed in the return comments that the jacket arrived dirty and used and I was disappointed. I returned it the next morning to UPS. I had inquired about the status of my return with CG about ten days later, they said it was holidays, it should be processed shortly, no issues. The next morning I woke up to an email saying my return didn’t meet the return standards and they had shipped it back, the day EARLIER, the same day I spoke to customer service! They said it was worn, dirty and washed! the EXACT reason I returned it to begin with. They had already shipped it back to me the day before they confirmed they were sending it back, via email. I have been calling since last Thursday asking to speak with a supervisor. They told me I’d hear back from a supervisor in 24-48 hours. It’s been 3.5 business days with no call back. I don’t expect them to fix this based on the lack of help I’ve received. The replacement I ordered came in, ironically it also reeks of someone else’s perfume. I’m nervous if I try to return it, they’ll blame me for that, again! Now I’m stuck with two expensive, poor QA jackets that I need to return because they don’t do exchange andI could only return and re-buy. Terrible QA, terrible return experience and unhelpful customer service. Update: I received a call from a very rude supervisor who talked over me with no interest in listening or helping. She immediately told me that they were sticking with their decision to blame me for the dirty jacket. I asked for proof and she said doesn’t have details from the warehouse. I asked to speak with someone else and she talked over me for at least 30 seconds not willing to listen to anything and said she was the highest level of management. I gave them proof in the return details with photo that it was sent to me dirty, but they refused to acknowledge the photo I sent. Unbelievable. They said the decision was final. I have escalated with my credit card company.  This is not ethical business behaviour and they will continue to lose brand loyalty with this kind of customer service. Second update: they have confirmed the jacket is used and dirty in the reply.  No one is disputing that. The problem is that they sent it to me this way. They have picture proof too. Pretty terrible business practice here, and again, no customer service support.","January 07, 2025"

I tried the number listed on the website four times and waited two hours to speak with a customer service agent. My very expensive Canada Goose jacket was a Christmas gift in 2019. The jacket is coming apart under the arms and on the cuffs. It was black when I first got it but it looks more grey now. The colour has faded drastically. The stitching on various sections of the jacket are broken. If I had read these reviews before I asked my husband to buy this coat, I would not have asked for it. Turns out the jacket has had the same problems with coming apart at the seams and fading in colour with many other purchasers listed above. Logistically, I could have had at least 4 brand-new jackets in the six years I was able to use this one. Be aware that this product does not stand the test of time. I recommend that you buy a coat from Sport Check, it will last longer and will be 1/5 of the price. Also, my Canada Goose did not last through 6 Canadian winters.

They did .I spoke to another lady who fully understood my frustration and said she felt bad that I had gone through all this through no fault of my own .She called me today as promised and said she had fought my case as she agreed but someone had made a decision not to refund .She said I could not speak to the  decision maker and neither could she as she just communicates through email with whoever it is .Apparently my case is now closed even though I was never told a case had been opened .If this is how Canada Goose treat their customers it’s beyond shameful .I have also tried to contact them through Facebook and LinkedIn but looks like they can’t be bothered to reply .I suggest the directors/management of Canada Goose stand in their own queue and experience what the people who pay their salaries are put through .I have not finished with this yet and will keep this site updated.A very disgruntled customer who is £375 out of pocket and does not even have hoodie to carry out my own tests on it .I am posting this message on CG Facebook page and linked in page as well as sending it as a private message via LinkedIn to as many Canada Goose staff worldwide.Let’s see if anyone at CG cares .","December 27, 2024"
"Tania Cyr","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-3.svg","I have a Canada Goose jacket. It is not new (7 years old or so), however, I sent it back to Canada Goose November 2021 due to a defect in the stitching in the arm and to inspect the colour fading. They fixed the defect in stitching and changed the cuffs that were tearing (thank you). I had to chase them again for the fading, they said that for the amount of years I have had the jacket (5-years ish) that is was normal!? It looks crappy, it’s Navy blue looks grey, colour is uneven all over, the stitching is now undone under one arm and in both pockets! I am very disappointed and would assume that for the price it would last at least 10 years. It just constantly looks like I am rubbing against a car full of salt :-( My cousin has a Canada Goose Jacket over 10 years old as his main jacket (I have a few more) and it still look new with no fading.","December 25, 2024"
"Daniel Lapena","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I am not sure where to start. After discovering that there was a 1 cm tear on one of the pockets of my parka, due to simple usage, very little usage, I decide to (instead of taking him to the tailor next door) use the top level warranty repair service from Canada Goose. Just to discover they have the worst customer service experience who will treat you like if you were a rat trying to take advantage of them and their warranty service. After spending nearly $2k on a parka the least you can expect is a top level of customer service, let alone top quality of the garment. But the reality is the opposite. And this is less than 2 years after purchasing it.First the make you upload around 5 photos from every angle of the coat, issue and receipt. 1 week later the “accept” the case asking you to pay to send it and in a very passive aggressive way, to also take it to the dry cleaner (and attach the receipt!) otherwise you will have to pay to have it cleaned by them. Half a month into the process they decide that the tear is “accidental damage” without giving me any more details, asking you to pay to have it returned. How sure you need to be to call a customer a liar over a micro tear that could an accident as well as a product of the quality of the material. Despite my multiple attempts to ask for a repair (not even a replacement at this stage), they would not listen to me or allow me to discuss over the phone. All is done over email with a 2 day delay on every exchange. General phone customer service, was delightfully useless with regards to any escalations. At least they had the “nice” gesture of sending it back free of charge. The rest was attempt after attempt to get the assurance someone would be able to come to their senses and at least repair it, but no. The only thing they could offer was another review at my cost (later at theirs after insisting). Ultimately, 1.5 months into this process I decide to give up and avoid another month of back and forth, missing typer coldest days of winter. The local tailor fixed it in 20 min for £10.After all this, my conclusion here is that the only accident for me was the moment I decided to buy a Canada Goose garment. Fingers crossed I don’t have to ever use their customer service or warranty services ever again.","November 20, 2024"

"C E","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-2.svg","I bought my Canada Goose mens knitted Hybridge Jacket for 695.00 plus tax from Neiman Marcus on 10/16/24. As of now the jacket is useless because the zipper teeth do not line up and the zipper gets stuck when trying to take the jacket off and I usually have to pull the jacket over my head to get it off. Customer service although nice started a warranty claim but decided to tell me that usually for warranty service you have to pay for shipping and handling as well as a cleaning fee, but the customer service rep said she was emailing the appropriate department to see if the fees could be waived since the jacket is so new and I needed to wait 24 to 48 hours for approval. Oh thank you for trying to back your own 695.00 jacket that failed within 2 months from the date of purchase as Neiman Marcus wouldn't take it back either. I think the correct response should be like with any other comany of much less value we will send you a return receipt immediately and get this fixed for you as soon as possible. BTW 4 to 6 week wait time to get this fixed. Higher price goods worse service, lesser price goods better service. I have a patigonia 180.00 perfection, and I bet if I have an issue the sporting goods store I bought it from would take it back in a heartbeat and replace it or give me a store credit asap.

My jacket from day one was not water repellent I would freeze to point of soaking wet saturated jacket in light snow. I  let them know ASAP the first few weeks of owning the Cyprus Hooded Ladies Sage Jacket. You’re paying for a luxury name here there is no high end great quality fabric to keep you warm it’s a fashion jacket here folks. Your better off to save your money and buy different brand.  It was never washed how could the DWR diminish over time it was a brand new jacket. Why are you replying to my comment on my Trust Pilot comment when you never answered my emails? You know I have a health issue and you went ahead and had the jacket heavily sprayed with the toxic DWR before contacting me first. At least if you would have let me know before hand that this is the route you go with warranty I would have declined and accepted the fact  I wasted $1200 on a brand name jacket that’s really a cheaply made jacket. So if your jacket becomes wet and saturated from snow or light rain. Canada Goose just resprays your jacket with  DWR which contains PFAOS and is known to be toxic.

So much hassle, worst experience ever! NEVER buy from them.Reference of my other review:Worst experience EVER!!! Do not ever buy Canada GooseIf there was a score to go -100, i would absolutely give Canada Goose that. The returns process for online orders has been the most painful and frustrating experience i’ve had from a supposedly luxury brand. 1. The returns documents didn’t include a commercial invoice, which was such a hassle for DHL pickups as the courier would not accept the return parcel. 2. The return parcel was stuck in customs in the Netherlands, about 1.5 months and counting as I write this. This was because they couldn’t figure out the duties and taxes themselves! 3. Lastly, I still don’t have my $2000 refund after 1.5 months. Every day I have been emailing them and reaching out to Live Chat Support and none of them could be of any help.

"Adam Mian","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I paid $800 CAD (with tax) for a very stylish rain jacket. (Kent men's jacket)Loved the styling, as I could use it as an overcoat with a suit, or also as a casual jacket for a night out.From product description:""This slim-fit jacket is designed with our flexible and breathable Tri-Durance SS fabric that blocks strong winds and rain.""The first few times I wore it in light rain, I could swear i was getting wet underneath, on my upper back/shoulders - but questioned whether maybe I didn't have the hood up and it was getting in that way.One day in a medium rain I got home to discover I was SOAKED - and had had it tightly zipped and hood on the entire time.  I contacted their customer service, who sent me shipping instructions to send it back to them to 'have the waterproof coating re-applied' - at my cost to ship.They also sent a warning that if the garment wasn't sent cleaned to their standards, a 'cleaning fee' would be imposed.  To be sure of this, I called them and asked for detailed cleaning instructions.  (wash cold, LAY FLAT to dry).  This took a couple extra days to do before I was ready to send.  Sent it to them with a HANDWRITTEN NOTE confirming that I'd cleaned it to their instructions.Some time later, I get a mail from them saying they had received it and were proceeding to inspection.  Immediately after that, another mail advising that it would need to be cleaned, and they would be invoicing me $25-$45, ""depending on the care instructions of your product"".I messaged them back with an incredulous message, and eventually they graciously advised that they would wave the fee.Fast forward 1 month, and I finally get the jacket back.  As by this time it was summer (and a very dry one at that), I hung the jacket in my closet and didn't think on it again.The very first time I finally went to use the jacket again was Remembrance Day, Nov 11.  I stood outside in a light drizzle for an hour.  When I got home, I was again absolutely soaked in the same area.  I couldn't believe it!I called and they wanted me to open a NEW case #.  I told them this hadn't been resolved from the last one, and that they must not have actually tested the jacket after 'waterproofing' it again.They wanted to repeat the process from before, however this time I insisted they pay for return shipping - and that I wanted them to thoroughly test what is obviously a defective jacket.  Note that this jacket even now looks just as new - and has not been worn more than a dozen times.. gently.Repeated the cleaning process (despite it only being worn the once since return!), and had them put a note on file that I was cleaning it.When they received it this time, I got the following message:""We hope this email finds you well.Our Quality Assurance team conducted a thorough inspection of your garment, and it was determined that the condition reflects normal wear and tear. As such, we are unable to provide repairs for your parka as these types of issues are not covered under our warranty.As a result, no other repairs can be offered at this time. We will now arrange for your garment to be returned it to you at our expense to the following address: ""What an absolute failure to stand by their product!Jacket leaked from day 1, has NO visible wear (I plan to take photos and videos) - and just how does one 'wear and tear' a jacket on the upper back and shoulders?!I have never regretted a clothing purchase so much in my life.Premium pricing - for dollar-store quality and no company support of their products.=======Added in response to Canada Goose reply:1) Where in your marketing of this product did you ever state this is a 'wind jacket designed to repel light splashes'?!Here is the retailer I purchased it from:  takeitoutside dot ca/products/mens-kent-jacket Read online description.  This OFFICIAL RETAILER also apparently isn't aware of the new description you give in your reply - as we discussed my intended use at length when comparing with other products they had in store.  They advised that not only was this supposedly completely weatherproof, but was backed by your company's great 'lifetime warranty'.2) Yes, you supposedly re-applied your DWR coating when I sent it in for inspection after it initially wouldn't repel any water from NEW, wore it ONCE in a light rain and it failed terribly!! (anyone interested can look up the weather in Halifax, NS Canada on Nov 11 at 11:00 to see how light the rain was).  How do you try to pawn that off with a comment such as 'diminishes after repeated use and cleaning' when this was literally the first time I wore it after your 're-treatment'?This response from you shows everything potential customers need to see about your business practices.","November 10, 2024"

Unfortunately, if you run into issues with these items, don’t expect any help from their customer service—they won’t lift a finger.Even with jackets, their warranty is riddled with so many clauses that it feels like they’ve set it up to deny service as often as possible.

I contacted Canada Goose who informed I had to send in a copy of all receipts as well as photos to verify the make and purchase details etc.The photos were forwarded 3 times to which they asked for the jacket to be sent by post back to Canada Goose.Due tor value of the jacket and that it was only a zipper tag I was unprepared to post the jacket back as they also asked for the jacket to be dry cleaned before posting. There were emails sent back and forward with me not getting much joy this was in April 24 . Having not  heard anything further in October 24 I therefore contacted customer service not warranty claims where I was lucky enough to be dealt with by a lady Named Marianna. Marianna listened to my plight and informed she would arrange for a new tag to be sent by post with no charge. Within 3 days the tag arrived by DSL and is now on my jacket.How refreshing it was to have a positive experience from a livley woman who listened and dealt with my issue promptly and stuck by her word. Thank you very much Marianna if only there weee more people like you in the modern world instead of these robots of people who cannot take any initiative and deal with people like human beings.Excellent service from a top customer service employee and a breath of fresh air .

"Gavin Naish","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","The most upsetting and insane lack of ownership of a problem i have ever encountered. After purchasing a premium brand at high cost the item was too big, so i initiated a return and waited for a refund so i could purchase a smaller size. After 9 days a box arrived back at my house from DHL with a coat stuffed in it damaged by god knows who, this was not in the same condition i sent it back in. Clearly the returns process is corrupt. As there was no indication why this was returned i called the customer service centre only to be told that i had damaged the item and it was returned, missing parts, back to me. I instigated a PayPal claim as a back up, and upon doing this Canada goose lost all interest in dealing with the problem. Continually fobbed off, i sent a 56 page letter of complaint detailing how i sent the coat back versus how it was returned back to me, which has been totally ignored. i was told to send this to another department, so i did, and again no acknowledgement or reply at all. It seems that there is no interest in after care, after-sale support at all. Nor is there any interest in actually resolving the issue or speaking with customers.  By far the worst experience i have ever received to date of any retailer. Currently i am £1800 out of pocket and have nothing to show for it, no product, return delivery charges and still no refund other than many hours of lost work. I have never left a negative review in my life, its only out of pure frustration that you take this action in the hope that someone might reach out to you prior to legal action. Case no  00730344edit after Canada Goose response, you are missing the point - i am 100% calling you out that your returns department are committing fraud and have been reported as such as they damaged the item. Post the video i sent of the coat in immaculate condition. Or the pictures. Is this your policy to accuse customers who purchase products online of damaging goods?, honeslty absolutley pathetic. Why not post the video you took when the coat was taken out of the box at the returns centre? Yet again, no one takes any responsiblity for what is a very serious issue. Fraud has been committed at your returns centre.","October 03, 2024"

If you’re wanting to purchase one be warned after a few month of wearing they start fading and look old and scruffy on you.and for record fading after a few months is not accidental damage or wear and tear.

"Jake","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","My partner recently noticed that her 2-year-old Canada Goose Parka (£1050) has its fur falling out at an insane rate.  Literally hair all over the place such that it can’t even be worn anymore(it would make a big mess wherever she goes).I have the male version of this parka, kept in the same storage and worn under identical conditions (and all per the care guidelines / instructions) and mine is of course perfectly okay.One of the things that sold us on these parkas was the ""lifetime warranty"", so we were shocked when Canada Goose replied that this would not be covered in any way.   Thinking that maybe they misunderstood the extent of the hair fall, she sent another email and, again, they replied that it is considered “wear and tear”, which is absolutely insane.  No one should expect their parka to start falling apart on its own after 2 years - especially at the premium prices that Canada Goose charges.We will never buy another Canada Goose product again.  I wish trust pilot had existed prior to purchasing our parkas, as we are shocked that so many others are having similar problems and that they are not covering this as defective.","September 16, 2024"
"Stuart Britton","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-3.svg","It was a fairly warm, and lightweight but not a durable, or well made coat. The materials quickly discolour, fray and wear out. I suggest using a more hard-wearing material for construction. If I worked at your research and development department, I would ruffle a few feathers. That's the main weak point of the coat. The cheap material used and the poor quality of construction. Another problem with it is the length and colour choice. I bought a Langford Parker, which was barely long enough. Another six inches would be needed to keep the knees warm. Most offerings forget the lower body as if only the upper parts needed warmth. The lengths are quite silly. How short are you planning on going before customers start complaining? The colours offered are dreadful- mostly black and some depressing greys. You need a good clothes designer who understands colour.","September 14, 2024"

"Henrik","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I have been a Canada Goose customer for many years, and have never used their warranty program previously. The fur ruff on my less than 3 year old jacket became damaged, and I discovered that the fur was of questionable quality. Accordingly, I submitted a warranty claim. Canada Goose requested that I shipped the fur ruff, which I did.After receiving the item and also requesting a photo of the inside label of my jacket, Canada Goose informed me that fur ruffs were not covered under the warranty program. Also, that the damage resulted from ""improper care"". Canada Goose added that it had been decided to discontinue fur usage, and so was unable to offer any repair or replacement of the fur ruff. I objected, finding no such limitation in the warranty program documentation, and not agreeing that the item had been cared for improperly - rather, the damage appeared to be the result of a quality issue. Furthermore, I discovered that Canada Goose was continuing the sale of fur trimmed garments, while informing me that fur related warranty claims were no longer being serviced. Despite my objections, Canada Goose maintained the original decision, and refused to work with me to find a reasonable solution. I am sorry that Canada Goose does not stand behind their products, and I will make sure to avoid Canada Goose products going forward.

But the trade-in program is such a disappointment and scam in a way as you as a customer has no saying as all! once you sent in your item, you just have to accept whatever credit you get and they won't return the item if you are not happy with the result. of course, they won't return as they can make the profit again reselling it way higher price than they offered you. It's such a scam as their assessment process is not transparent, you only get a email saying, hey this is all you get for your jacket! I complained about how unfair the program is and demanded to send back my parka( agreed to return the gift card)They refused and stopped communicating with me. I am very upset and will make sure my friends will not use the trade-in program. And will stop purchasing any Canada goose product.

"Harry Archard","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I have used my jacket for a number of years now and I have always amazed at how warm and sturdy it is. However the cuffs eventually succumbed to wear and tear with holes appearing so I sent it for repairs under warranty. The initial warranty repair service was good as they paid for postage and fixed the issue under warranty. However they tried to charge me for dry cleaning which I had already had done before sending it in and sent proof of this with the jacket, I then had to email Canada goose sending the same proof. It was then agreed that it had been cleaned and an inspection and repair was carried out. When I received the jacket back there was a new tear around the front pocket which was not there when the jacket was sent. I then contacted customer service about damage and they emailed back to say the tear was present during the initial inspection but was irreparable and must have been caused by accidental damage. The tear was never mentioned by the warranty service following the inspection at the time and I was informed of all other defects found but heard and knew nothing about the tear until I received the coat back. The fact that this damage was blamed on me as a way for Canada Goode to save money is unacceptable given the price of the jacket.

I purchased a coat from an authorized retailer, White in Den Haag, and after only two years, the coat began to show significant discoloration. This was unexpected given the high price and reputation of Canada Goose products.In 2021 I sent my coat to Canada Goose for warranty service, hoping they would address the discoloration issues (few spots). Unfortunately, after receiving the coat back, the discoloration had worsened, and the overall condition of the coat had deteriorated. Despite my repeated attempts to resolve the issue, including providing detailed photos and explanations, Canada Goose has consistently denied responsibility, attributing the damage to improper care and environmental factors, rather than acknowledging a potential manufacturing defect or the impact of their own cleaning process.Their customer service has been frustratingly unhelpful, repeatedly directing me to address my concerns with the original retailer, even though the discoloration was clearly caused by their warranty service. Furthermore, they have refused to replace the coat, despite their own policy stating that products with manufacturing defects should be repaired or replaced.I am left with an expensive coat that no longer meets the quality standards I expected from Canada Goose. This experience has been incredibly disappointing, and I would caution others about the effectiveness and reliability of Canada Goose's warranty service.

I purchased a blue Rossclare Parka jacket in January 2023. The cost was over £1000.The fabric had faded around the seams of the arms by the end of the year and I sent the coat in for a warranty review in January 2024. Canada Goose acknowledged the coat as faulty. I have been toing and froing with them now for 4 months to receive a replacement coat in blue.Canada Goose refuse to offer me a replacement other than what they have in WARRANTY STOCK which is black or white.The blue coat is available online outside the UK but they will not offer me that option.When I speak to the customer care team they are entirely sympathetic with my position that when I choose to spend £1000 + on a jacket I want a specific colour - blue on this occasion. However when I go in to writing the only response I get is a gift card to the amount of the jacket or a replacement in black or white. I can’t get my money back even if I wanted it. What is so disappointing is the disingenuous way that I am dealt with, CG hold themselves out to be all about customer care. My request is entirely reasonable. CG are able to replace my jacket, like for like, but refuse to do so. What is WARRANTY STOCK? It is a complete con, CG are really letting themselves down with this approach to their customers. I think we can only assume this as a product of private equity ownership when it is all about profits NOT customers. Shame on you Mr Reiss (who sadly does not even have the courtesy to respond to my representations but hides behind the customer service Team).Any experience of others to help me make progress with CG would be gratefully received!UPDATE - as you can see CG have responded. I note with interest the final paragraph:‘we do not take your feedback for granted as it has been duly forwarded to the appropriate department. We do hope that we are able to re-gain your trust in our brand as we look forward to serving you again in the near future.’I have asked CG to address this statement with honesty and integrity. I very much hope to be able to update this post further to advise that they have GENUINELY sought to regain my TRUST IN THEIR BRAND.

I would therefore advise everybody to stay away from this brand as the warranty is just a scam, and used as a bait when buying the product, but when you claim everything will refuted. I will definitely be staying away from this brand in the future and urge others to do the same","April 18, 2024"
"Ruth","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I purchased a brand new coat and owned it for one month and two days when the stitches started to come undone in one arm. I contacted Canada Goose for the lifetime warranty, after weeks and weeks (6-8 week process) to be told that nothing could be done and they were sending the coat back to me. I do not recommended this company.","April 15, 2024"
"Eveach","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-5.svg","Canada Goose - I recently purchased the Rossclair Parka Black Label and in 2019 the Berkley Coat. They are both made with excellent quality and their service was exceptional. I received free shipping on both items. They are packed with a wooden hanger and a bag cover to keep your coat in great condition. The box was fancy too. I had a business trip to DC during the winter storms and the Rossclair Parka kept me warm throughout. The hood was perfect in the cold wind and the style was nice. I received so many compliments as I kept warm and comfortable.The Berkley is a lighter weight jacket and is ideal for everyday use. I love the straps that you can carry your jacket as a backpack so it doesn’t take up all your luggage room. I definitely will purchase from Canada Goose again","January 27, 2024"
"Daniel","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-5.svg","Dear Canada Goose,I deeply appreciate your heartfelt response to my Trustpilot review. It's truly uplifting to receive such genuine appreciation from a company as esteemed as Canada Goose.Your dedication to craftsmanship and attention to detail shines through in every aspect of your products, and I'm delighted that my experience reflects that commitment.With the onset of the winter months, I eagerly anticipate broadening my Canada Goose collection. The Pom Cashmere Beanie Ribbed is next on my list, and I'm certain it will become another cherished addition to my wardrobe, providing both style and comfort during my outdoor pursuits.Once I've acquired the beanie, I'll be sure to provide a review. Given my exceptional experience with the Gilet, I have no doubt that the beanie will surpass my expectations as well.Thank you once again for your exceptional customer care. Your responsiveness and dedication only serve to strengthen my loyalty to Canada Goose.Warm regards,Daniel","April 03, 2024"

You have to pay for cleaning if it wasn’t cleaned beforehand but I would let Canada Goose do the cleaning and you pay them as professional cleaning I found to be more expensive. Not everything was covered in warranty so it could get costly my jacket cost 105 to replace the sleeve, 30 to send in and 45 for dry cleaning. Canada Goose pays for the shipping back to you.

"Debbie","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-5.svg","After much deliberation, I finally succumbed to the allure of the Canada Goose jacket, and I can confidently say, it’s been a game-changer. As someone battling Raynaud’s and cold-induced urticaria, finding the perfect balance of style, warmth, and protection seemed like an insurmountable task. However, the moment I slipped into this jacket, I was smitten.First and foremost, the fit is impeccable. Too often, winter coats sacrifice style for functionality, but not this one. It hugs my body in all the right places, accentuating my figure while still allowing room for layering underneath. The tailored silhouette not only adds a touch of elegance but also prevents cold air from sneaking in, providing a barrier against the elements.Speaking of which, the warmth this jacket provides is unparalleled. Even in the harshest of winter conditions, I remain cozy and comfortable, thanks to its premium insulation and innovative design. Whether I’m braving blustery winds or trekking through snow-covered streets, I can trust that this jacket will keep me toasty warm, allowing me to enjoy winter activities without the fear of Raynaud’s flare-ups or urticaria outbreaks.But perhaps what truly sets this jacket apart is its attention to detail when it comes to protection. From the adjustable hood with a luxurious fur trim to the durable, water-resistant outer shell, every element has been meticulously crafted to shield me from whatever Mother Nature throws my way. Even the pockets are strategically placed and lined with fleece, offering both functionality and comfort.In conclusion, the Canada Goose jacket has exceeded all my expectations and then some. It’s not just a coat; it’s a winter essential that has transformed my cold-weather experience. So if you’re on the fence about investing in one, take the leap—you won’t regret it. Embrace winter bliss with the trifecta of style, warmth, and protection that this remarkable jacket provides.","February 05, 2024"

(Non luxury side)One of their staff member threw away my belongings that I had left on the counter into the trash can while I was trying on one of the jackets. I asked the staff members to please find my belongings and no one cared to help me and I had to dig out my stuff from the trash can myself. (Yes I am talking about you, Mr. Baby Blue sweater, black curly haired Arab gentleman with gold necklace)Then another staff member proceeded to tell me that my exchange would be “final sale” because I had left my lipstick in the pocket while trying on the jacket. The jacket sat in my closet until it was brought to the store to be returned. Pretty outrageous reasoning.During that short period of an hour that I spent in their store, felt like I was being treated like a homeless person, soliciting at their business place when I had just purchased a $1600 jacket. Truly, I’ve had better customer service experience at a gas station. At least they don’t touch my belongings and throw them into the trash.This is already my second purchased item from Canada goose, but with this extremely frustrating experience, I never want to shop from Canada goose again if this is hiw their representatives treat their customers.","February 01, 2024"

The slippers are exactly as ordered and in perfect condition, for which I am grateful. However, the boots tell a different story. They exhibit noticeable differences in color, appearing faded or discolored. Please refer to the attached images for clarification. As these boots were intended as a gift, the disappointment is even more profound.I have been a loyal customer of Canada Goose for years, regularly purchasing various items such as jackets, coats, sweaters, gloves, etc., from both the Canada Goose store in Frankfurt and Breuninger. My past experiences with in-store purchases have always been positive, allowing me to inspect and ensure the quality of the items before making a purchase.

You didn’t even try to fix this problem this is exactly what I am talking about they just talk nonsense at this company I swear ! Nothing gets done this company lied on me and said I never contacted when I had proof I contacted them several times once I received the package that was empty I told them and I was promised a refund and some kind of follow up once they tried to figure out what was going on and guess what they never called me back not once ! So I contacted my credit card company and this company Canada goose lied and said I never contacted them which was a lie I contacted them on the phone and through email with proof that we had been in correspondence but this company will try to deceive everyone ! Even now this person who respond didn’t try to fix my problem they said we hope we can regain you trust in the future who would want to trust your company you didn’t even do anything to fix this problem you wrote a bunch of nonsense and said you were sorry how does that help me at all I’m out 595.00 that your company stole from me your a multimillion dollar company stealing 595.00 from working class people then lying about things to keep the money from the customers why would anyone want to buy from your company again it was my first and worst experience with any company ever in my life I don’t recommend anyone make any purchases with them just look at they’re response does that seem like they care to earn my trust all they said was we are sorry you feel that way !

It's good that they don't charge the shipping for sending in and sending back the cloth they don't want. The trade-in process was smooth, but the result was just far below my expectations.","March 07, 2024"

My 800cad pants are very stiff and don't really give me the same experience and feeling for many other brand on this range price.

In the end, I felt very boring, so I just chose the clothes I planned to buy and asked for a smaller size. She didn't even check and said no. I saw on the website that there was one. And since I’m in a Yorkdale store, is there so little stock? Finally, she wrote my name wrong. Up to now, the emails I receive from Canada Goose all show my wrong name, reminding me of this very unpleasant shopping experience. In the end, they didn’t even give me a shopping bag. Just put my clothes and a dust cover on it and that’s it! Later, I continued to look at other brands in the mall and bought a Chanel bag.

They wouldn’t replace the jacket but only my hood trim and sent me a gift card in the amount for a new one. Approaching December with no jacket in Ontario to no fault of my own shouldn’t be ANYONES concern when dealing with such a prestigious company.

I have washed it once since buying so after ONE wash it lost all ability to withstand rain, any rain and any elements whilst it withstood rain and cold it was DRY it literally repelled water it did not soak, in winter I wore shirt sleeve tops the jacket was so hot. I was very happy with it. After one wash the coat is worse than Primark.I cannot believe CG just dismissed my claim without even dropping the coat at the store.

Brought a bodywarmer in October but needed to get dry cleaned in late Jan as it was a light coloured bodywarmer so got a little bit dirty. Sent off to their authorised dry cleaners - Jeeves of Belgravia, who managed to destroy my zipper label. They attempted to repair it but it looked awful so I rejected their repair. I was advised to go through Canada Goose Warranty claim which I did. Claim went through but they had trouble receiving my pictures (sent email 3 times) but after speaking to a customer service representative on the phone, they agreed to send out the zipper label. They have now gone back on their word and still requesting the pictures again. There a lot of effort on my part to resolve something that Canada Goose and Jeeves of Belgravia have caused. The fact they have now gone back on what they said they would do just tells you everything about this company. Not to be trusted and do not honour their word.","February 20, 2024"

So I contacted UPS, and they said Canada Goose blocked the package so I have to contact them to change anything, UPS assistant can't do anything at this point. update: I contacted Canada Goose for a 1 hour call, I said UPS can't make any change for this package, and they need to contact with sender directly for any change, CG responded me they couldn't change it and I had to contact UPS again, so I called UPS AGAIN, and they gave me the same response, that they have a contract that neither the UPS agent nor receiver can make any change, only the sender has the power to do that, I understand it's for safety and it makes sense. So I contacted again for CG, and they gave me the same response for a contact back to UPS, I told them what UPS told me, and CG said they had nothing to do that, but I only needed them to contact with UPS to help me do a minor change on address, you know what, the CG agent just HANG UP MY PHONE!OMG, check what CG replied below, they just like a robot, just keep repeating the same sentence","February 11, 2024"

"Klodian","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I recently encountered a frustrating situation with Canada Goose that has compelled me to share my disappointment. My premium parka went missing during a trip to the repair, leading me to seek assistance from Canada Goose's customer support.To my dismay, the experience was far from satisfactory. Not only did the company fail to provide a solution for my lost parka, but their customer support seemed more adept at avoiding my questions than addressing them directly.The disappearance of my expensive parka was distressing enough, but the lack of transparency and responsiveness from Canada Goose made the situation even more disheartening. As a customer who invested in their high-end product, I expected better support and accountability.Unfortunately, Canada Goose fell short of meeting these expectations, leaving me with unresolved issues and a sense of frustration. I share this experience in the hope that others can make informed decisions about their purchases, taking into consideration not just the quality of the product but also the reliability of the customer support. In this instance, Canada Goose's customer service left much to be desired, and it's something potential buyers should be aware of before investing in their products.","January 30, 2024"

I was told I could not return my coat as the tag was no longer on it. We still had the boxes and receipt, but one tag was missing. Now I’m stuck with a very expensive coat that doesn’t fit. The customer service was terrible. I called three times. The first time they said they would speak to a manager about a special exception to return the coat without a tag. They promised to get back to me. They did not get back to me. The second time the same thing happened. The third time they told me no they would not take the coat back or even give store credit so I could get the correct size. After three calls there was no resolution to my problem. Frustrating policy for a coat at this price point. Terrible customer service. I would not recommend this company.

"Ron","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-2.svg","I regret my purchase. First, I live in NY and bought the jacket at a CG store in Montreal which is more than 5 hours from where I live. First week I had an issue with the jacket and the CG store in NYC told me I had to go back to the store where I purchased it in Canada. As aggravated as I was by that policy I was even more aggravated when I called the CG store in Canada where I purchased the jacker and was told they will not allow me to send the jacket to them--you have to bring it back in person and exchange it. That's a problem since the jacket configuration I sought after and purchased is extremely difficult to find. The problem involved the zipper; it is extremely difficult to engage and forget about doing it with gloves on. I expected the zipper on a $1,750 jacket would be of better quality. The first week I also noticed the zipper tab stitching at the bottom of the tab was coming apart. The tab is certainly not essential, but a part that likely costs about two cents and helps with zipping up and down particularly when wearing gloves.  I called CG and was instructed to email several photos including the interior tags, and interior and exterior labels. A week after I did so, I get an email asking me to fill out a form and to send the same photos--all for a tab that costs cents. Lastly, I find the down leak inside the jacket extraordinary considering the price and supposed quality of CG products. I had only been wearing the jacket lightly around the city over light sweaters and people have been picking feathers off my clothing when I take my jacket off. I had been trying to replace a parka for two seasons. My choice was down to CG Langford Heritage Black Label Parka and Arc'Teryx Therme SV Parka. I regret buying the CG.","January 20, 2024"

Poor quality product, at an exceptional high price, non-existent customer service, warrantee service when or if they even respond to a problem and a return policy that is not communicated unless you know to ask.

First let me just say that it is ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR that they have the ""Canada Goose Generation Program for trade in"" only operating in Canada/US and nothing in Europe/UK...WHY?!?! It took me ages to sell my Parka and I have constantly got contacted by scammers, very stressful situation. For such an expensive Parka (£1.5K) the service should be premium EVERYWHERE and not only in Canada/US!Then, and it is not only me saying it, the quality of the Parkas really went down, not really understandable as the price has nearly doubled in the past 7 years.I went to Canada Goose London Regent Street and while trying a Langford Parka Heritage in my size, I noticed that the fur was nothing to compare with my old Carson Heritage. Instead of having a nice and thick goldy Coyote fur, it was some light and fuzzy white and grey fur, very flimsy and not even stitched properly as some of the fur hairs flying everywhere (I asked to try another one and it was the same situation). Also in the fur hood trim they removed the metal wire allowing you to shape it nicely so when the hood is on, it was impossible to see anything and I was looking like a complete idiot with the fur covering my face, such a stupid idea of removing the absolutely essential metal wire!I asked the staff to ask the manager if it was possible to swap the hood trim, or to get it custom made upgraded or just to buy it separate and the answer was ""some parka come with it some does not"", well such a very useful explaination!I ended up not buying a new one as for £1.5K I really feel the quality has gone and the service in store or globally is absolutely not up to standard according the price mark of those items, very disappointing!","November 20, 2023"

In less than 30 days the stitching came undone near the left side pocket (jacket had been worn a handful of times & not in tough conditions). I completely appreciate that sometimes things can go wrong and manufacturing processes can never be without flaws. However, I emailed the warrenty/customer service team over 2 weeks ago now. I have had no responses in the way of a solution or next steps. I called the customer service helpline after 7 days had elapsed from the original claim, only to be told that ""I need to be patient"". I have sent photographs and proof of purchase to them as requested. To say I am disappointed is a huge understatement. I love the jacket and I am devastated that I am currently unable to wear such a nice product in the current cold weather. As a new customer I am also very disappointed so far in Canada Goose, this is the first item of their brand I have had and I would expect the price point and prestige of the name to be reflected in the customer service they offer. I have reluctantly written this negative review in the hopes that it highlights the poor performance so far, of their customer services department. I would also like to add that as a company, they are, at present, in breach of multiple sections of the UK consumer rights act 2015. Please rectify your shortfall here Canada Goose! You should be doing better for your customers!","November 07, 2023"

It was brand new with tags never worn and I would obviously pay the difference if a hat was more expensive. The manager that helped me was not considerate at all and told me that without a receipt it couldn’t do anything and that even if I had a receipt the chances my grandmother bought it within 30 days and gave it to me as a present then is slim. So why does Canada goose have a 30 day return window when people get things as a gift? That’s almost impossible for people to buy a gift, give the gift, and then have time to return the gift if it doesn’t fit. I think the policy is ridiculous and very inconsiderate. For a high end company like this I am NOT impressed and will be taking my business elsewhere.","November 21, 2023"

"Szymon Czerwiński","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Canada GOOSE IS CHEATING!I bought a jacket full of joy from CANADA GOOSE, from a company that prides itself on quality, customer service and its prestige! Nothing could be further from the truth! I advise you to be careful and think twice about your purchase! The jacket was slim - according to the procedure, I returned it via the return card received by DHL! The jacket was collected by an employee on October 30, 2023, as confirmed by DHL with his name and surname. Since that day, the company has not refunded the money! At first she claimed that she had not received the jacket and I had to personally prove to her that the goods had been delivered! From the moment of proof, indicating the name and surname of the person receiving it, the time, the day, did she change the narrative and claim to explain the matter? One time he claims that the finance department is analyzing the matter, another time he says they can't find the jacket in stock. Every second e-mail message indicates that it will take another 2 business days. I have already reported the matter to the bank as fraud, and I am also reporting it to the police! In Europe, there is no telephone to call, only an e-mail address to which someone responds every time! There is no help, no explanation, just corporate gibberish! I am shocked that it seems like this - which is wrong - a prestigious brand treats customers as thieves and due to its own mistakes and mess in the warehouse - illegally withholds customers' money! I do not recommend! I advise you to be careful so that you don't have the same problems as I did. I don't have several hundred euros and I don't have a jacket!","November 20, 2023"

"Stephanie perry","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-3.svg","The service was amazing when I purchased my coat this summer in prep for winter in alberta(recently moved back from the okanagan) but after wearing my coat on days that hovered just below 0 degrees I found the loft not thick enough to keep me warm without many layers. This is a sad thing since my older coat that I purchased in 2009 from you is warmer and more lofty. I am remiss to say that the quality of Canada goose has gone down and it is not keeping me warm like it did then with my older model. I am certain when it hits -30 which in theory it should withstand well against, I will be left feeling too cold to enjoy being outside for winter activities. So for the money I spent ( 3 times that of which I spent in 2009) I give this only 3 stars for the value and when I purchase my next winter coat likely I will not be returning to the Canada goose label.","June 05, 2023"

So I wasted around $35ish on shipping, waited a month to get it back not fixed... Still fighting with them and disputing their decision. Their so-called warranty is horrendous.

Refused to EXCHANGE a coat purchased in Canada with tags and receipts in the US because their policy is that it has to be done in the county it was purchased in.   I have not had any issue EXCHANGING gifts or purchases bought outside the US in their stores with any other luxury brand. I have purchased a few things from Canada goose without the need for costumer service so they are lucky they got that business out of me.

They did not specify on the trade in page that this was unacceptable and I wasted my time sending this coat out and now I have to wait for them to hopefully send it back .

"Alexey B","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I recently ordered a 850 pounds coat from Canada Goose, which unfortunately arrived damaged with stains. When I contacted customer support, I was shockingly not offered an exchange; only a return option.Furthermore, there's only one item of this particular model left in my size in the UK, and ordering from American websites is not a viable option for me. This means I have to shell out another 850 pounds to order a new coat and then wait for a refund, which is obviously far from ideal.To add to the inconvenience, the return process isn't as simple as dropping the item off at the post office; it involves arranging for a DHL pickup, which makes the whole process even more time-consuming and costly.The only solution Canada Goose offered me as compensation was a free next business day delivery for my next order, which is completely unsatisfactory, seeing as that is already the standard on their website. I am frankly shocked, outraged, and disappointed by this experience.","August 24, 2023"
"Tony Paraskevopoulos","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","In May I sent my coat  to Canada Goose to be cleaned as per the warranty. Several times I’ve been told since then nothing will be done to my coat because I can’t prove when I bought my coat with a receipt. I finally had a chance to speak to a manager, who actually listened and had my coat reinspected by the warranty team who dropped the ball. now a few repairs are being done to the coat i’ve only had this coat a year and has all these issues. I can’t phathom  how Canada goose can actually get away with this? Inside the coat there’s three tags that the warranty team uses to prove authenticity…. I’ve had this coat for at least a year now and a DWR is being put on my coat, so it doesn’t leak? My coat is  now being fixed the left and right cuffs I think they said the zipper is being replaced along with a couple other repairs? Somethings can be done as per the warranty without a receipt as a manufacturing defect but some manufacturing defects cannot be fixed without a receipt? Three months they had my coat and; if I didn’t speak to a particular manager nothing would’ve been done to my coat and it would’ve been shipped back to me the way it was . Finally, my coat is being sent back to me . I just received a text from the warranty team at at Canada Goose that my coat is being shipped back to me after three months! As per the manager, I’ve been told a goodwill gesture will be applied either a hat, scarf,or gloves one will be sent to me. There’s no promise which one though, but thank you Canada Goose you’re the best. I will never purchase anything from Canada Goose ever again after this. please be careful with Canada Goose because after this experience, I could tell you they don’t care about their customers at all.","May 30, 2023"

Canada goose had constantly told me to wait “a few days” for DHL’s response as they’re trying to locate the package. I asked for picture proof of the parcel of where it’s gone. Sent me a picture that is NOTTT my house and NOT MY CAR IN THE DRIVE. I explained I have a bright red door and a silver car. The picture showed a white car and a black door. Canada goose wasn’t interested continued to ask me to wait promising me a refund on “Thursday”. On Wednesday two weeks after my original purchase date, I received an email from customer services claiming I will not be receiving any refund or any coat as the picture shows it was delivered to my house. I even sent them a picture of my house and my door number clearly showing. Unfortunately I paid in store with cash so I cannot charge back and they have just blatantly robbed me. I asked the store for a letter of deadlock to report it to the ombudsman service and I’m told they cannot provide this. WORST COMPANY AND WORST BRAND EVER.","June 14, 2023"

"Mohammed Kassab","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I'm posting this review here because Canada Goose did not accept the review I wrote on their website. (seems they don't want people to see\hear my experience)I bought the lockport jacket online, but it turned out too big for me, and I did not like the look. It made me feel like I was a firefighter. So I immediately requested a return online less than 2 hours after receiving the coat. I got it packed and good to go. When their warehouse received it, they rejected the return and said there were signs of ""wear"" I only tried on the jacked and took it off. I didn't have it on for more than 5 minutes. I didn't go anywhere with it, and the tags are still on. I'm not sure what strict inspection they performed here, but it definitely feels overboard. If trying on a jacket causes ""wear"" then that tells me the quality of your jacket is very poor. This is the first time I've had a bad experience buying something online. I have no idea what else I could have done to prevent ""wear"" from trying a jacket on and packing it within 2 hours of receiving it. After all the back and forth with customer service over the phone, their resolution was to either sell it 2nd hand or travel to the USA and use their trade in program. Imagine a Canadian buying a jacket from a Canadian company in Canada being told to travel to the USA to trade in a jacket. The worst customer service I've ever witnessed. So it looks like im stuck with this jacket unless Canada Goose is willing to cover travel expenses to the USA. Very disappointed with the whole experience and I definitely wouldn't buy from Canada Goose again. I feel like I was taken advantage of. I hope all I have shared will help those thinking of being buying online. If you like their products, I strongly recommend going in-store if you can try on things, or else Canada Goose will force you to keep it.","April 24, 2023"

They repaired and sent back. within 3 months seams started coming apart to which i sent back and they repaired. What i received back from a company who say they have 'Superior Standards' looked like my dog had a go at it. The repair seams didn't meet and loose ends were hanging out.

"Mila","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","In December 2022 I ordered two jackets from Canada Goose for a €2990.00. Since both did not fit me, I had both jackets picked up at my door via courier as instructed on the website.Canada Goose later informed me that they had received a game for children (physics professionals) and so they cannot accept my return.I assured them several times that I packed everything correctly and pointed out that they bear the risk for the return. Despite available customer service, I received no help at all. They didn't want to give me my money back... I was asked again and again if I hadn't accidentally sent something else back... They also didn't open a case with courier. I did that myself.I then investigated on my own and found out that one of the ""missing jackets"" was being sold on an online market place not far from me. Made an appointment and called the police. In cooperation with a very courteous courier employee, I was able to determine from the profile of the person in question that she was selling other goods that had gone missing from the courier, which ultimately led to a house search and the seizure of the two jackets. It turned out that the courier employee (who picked up my package) had stolen the jackets and exchanged them in order to then sell them... Only when Canada Goose got the jackets back did I get my money back. All in all, the whole thing cost me a lot of nerves and time. I put more than 20 hours of work into this and I'm lucky that the jackets could be found in this way. Canada Goose would definitely not have fulfilled its obligation to give me my money back. Even the police file number and a report from the courier were not enough to confirm my story. Only when they got the jackets back in their hands did I get my money back. Without my full commitment, they would have had to give me back the money anyway and would certainly not have found the jackets either. I will definitely never buy or wear anything from this brand again. This was by far the most frustrating online shopping experience I have ever had. That's a violation of consumer rights.","December 15, 2022"

I heard Canada goose had the best warm jackets, but I guess it's not right.If you search right the best jackets for a cold Canadian weather are PARKAS with the highest FILL POWER. The jackets should also have MORE DUVET than feathers (preferably 90/10).I looked for parkas for a weather of -30 and below in Rudsak, Moose knuckles and Canadian wolf. I realized that some of those brands offered a fill power of 700 to 800+ fill power and a percentage of 90/10 duvet and feathers.I chatted with a representative in Canada goose and he ended the chat when I asked if they had a parka with those characteristics. They don't offer a better product than those other brands. if you check well they only offer parkas with a fill power of 650+ maximum!!!! Some of those even have 80% duvet and 20% feathers.I guess it's just the name and marketing. I mean if you search well is one the oldest brands, which means it has the name and the money to advertise their products.Please do your research well don't waste your money. Don't buy their products just because it's """"Canada goose"" If I hadn't done my research I would be buying a jacket of 2000$ last week.

"Charles Cazals","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-5.svg","Quite impressive, sent my jacket 8 years after I bought it, sleeves were starting to wear out and tear appart.Sent my jacked to them after submitting a customer service request, they made all the repairs for free, and sent it back to me also free of charge. I only had to pay for:- cleaning fees - if you clean it at your own dry cleaners, make sure to keep an invoice, as they do ask for proof- postal shipment only to send it to them - they pay for the return.When I got my jacket back, they had repaired even more than I asked for ! The sleeves were brand new and like the originals, they replaced some patches inside the coat and sewed back the mini holes near the sleeves. Everything looked brand new, super good work !ONE THING I WOULD IMPROVE:They also replaced the fur, which I had not asked for either. I would have preferred they didn't, and generally this is worth asking the customer about beforehand. Personally my opinion against real fur has grown since my purchase 8 years ago.","February 08, 2023"
"Olivier Mota","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","After years of hesitation, my wife and I took the decision to buy a coat each. In addition to a customer service in shop that was not necessarily at the level of a prenium brand (unpleasant saleswoman, no advice,...)I was surprised to discover, 2 months after my purchase, that my coat was losing feathers all over (inside and outside) through the seams (seams that were pulling out of the sleeves)Here I am, back in the Paris shop and I learn that the article is not exchangeable and that it must be sent under warranty (without having the guarantee that it will be in warranty?) for 5 weeks. It's very practical to send a coat for 5 weeks in the middle of winter, it will be more useful in spring...In short, and now to top it all off, Canada Goose has the temerity to ask for a cleaning fee before treating the problem.Besides the fact that I find this aberrant for a prenium brand to claim anything for a coat bought 1400€, this practice is illegal from a French law point of view.In addition, Canada Goose is legally supposed to rectify the problem within 30 days (whereas their announced delay is 5 weeks).I was very disappointed and expected much more from a brand of this standing. I think we can find much better elsewhere and at this price.","January 27, 2023"

What really angers me is that this is a Canadian company, and considered a standard of quality. I have a hard time to reconnect the poor quality of customer service with the appalling cost of their products. Reading several reviews below, I am not alone. I would appreciate if they could change the name from Canada Goose to something like...Stupid Goose, or maybe Greedy Goose?

"Jonathan","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Horrible company. This company is not what they used to be and their jackets are not quality made. The jacket has issues with becoming shiny from using their hand warming pockets, stitching coming apart, holes in the sleeves, fit coming off. Their warranty refused to help me with the same issue I’ve had in the past, they won’t even let you PAY for a repair. You pay this amount of money for a jacket and for a company that advertises lifetime warranty, it’s a sham. Canada Goose has turned into any other major brand now, greedy and they don’t care. Their customer service is also quite bad, they hype you up to let you know that the jacket is covered by warranty and you will have a new one only to be denied by the warranty team and you can’t even be transferred to speak to someone from there.Stay away from them and spend your money elsewhere. They definitely do not deserve your money and everything you’re reading below from other reviews is 100% true.","October 26, 2022"

They don’t have to worry about me spending another $1219.00 for their brand again. After this incident, I started to wonder if their product was worth the trouble and decided NO it is not!

Purchased a parka, started to fade at multiple locations. Dry cleaned the parka and sent to warranty department. They repaired some parts but not all as they claim it’s wear and tear. Total BS. How can it be considered wear and tear on some spots and not all. So I called the warranty department again to explain. The representative said she u understands and hears what I am saying. Recommended to send back the parka, so I did. I asked about the dry cleaning requirements and she said just don’t open the box as it has special tap to confirm tampering. Also my case number would be linked to the new case#.This will prove that it hasn’t been opened and won’t be required to be dry cleaned again. Now I got an email saying that my parka will be sent to dry cleaning and will be charged for the dry cleaning. I emailed the warranty department again, requesting for a callback. Once again, getting a email reply saying that dry cleaning is mandatory. I’m feeling this is a very small mom and pop shop with amazing marketing team but just operating out of a garage. My recommendation is to STAY AWAY from Canada goose and spend your money on a different brand.","October 19, 2022"

I paid cost for a replacement coat, which never arrived (shipment tracking indicated the product was returned to sender and never made it to my address or delivery city).  I contacted Canada Goose who then offered me a gift card, which never arrived.  However about a week after offering me a gift card, I received an email from a third-party indicating my gift card had been delivered.  Canada Goose acknowledged over email that the third party gift card provider accidentally sent the gift card to a Canada Goose employee as the recipient and sent me, as grantor, a delivery receipt.  Canada Goose apologized and assured me this would be rectified.  it has been three months since sending my coat and two weeks since the gift card cock-up and nothing despite multiple emails and telephone calls.

"Mats in Norway","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I can’t believe a quality brand like CG has such awful customer service. It’s a long story, but first they screwed up by over billing me when they sent me clothes last year. Then, out of the blue, I receive notification now (1 year later) saying they had shipped my goods. I wrote to them saying this must be a mistake, as I have not ordered anything since last year. They said it was a mistake in their system and that no clothes had been sent. So “no problem” they said … but then they invoice my MasterCard again (for the phantom order) after all. And now I’m having to fight for weeks to get them to cancel their incorrect double billing. And their smug emails where they refuse to own up to the mistake, and just keep “escalating the matter to a manager” are just awful. Fix the mistake, don’t send me repetitive emails about how valuable I am and how much you care and the focus my case is getting. Just fix it!

I checked the tracking numbers and the one which didn't arrive showed on the UPS site that it wasn't even shipped out yet.  I called Canada goose and all I was told was that they will ""investigate"". To me this is unacceptable. This shouldn't be my issue, this isn't even a delivery issue since the item didn't even make it to UPS. I cannot even get a garuntee of when they will ship me my item. They have the item in stock so I do not see why they cannot just ship me one and investigate the situation without inconvenienceing me. This isn't my issue and is no fault of my own so I do not understand why I am the one who needs to be ""patient"". The item WAS NOT SHIPPED it WAS PAID  FOR and IT IS IN STOCK. There is no valid reason to make me wait with an opened ended investigation. I was told that this was not the ""process"" but again that isn't my problem. I have followed the process where in the money was paid and I should receive a coat within the delivery window.

"Kelly KellyR","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I have purchased three Canada Goose jackets in the last 2 years - including the Salida Rain Jacket. I have recommended these jackets to everyone I’ve met as I believed so strongly in not only the quality but also the backing provided by the company via the warranty. Last month I met someone who had the same rain coat in the same colour - red - and was shocked to see her coat was so much brighter than mine. I knew the colour of my coat had faded - despite only being 1.5 years old - but I was shocked to see how different the colour was - when I compared it directly to the same one. It was honestly shocking. Mine is faded and has almost a white coating. I was aware the colour had changed - which shocked me given the cost and the fact I’ve only worn it around the city - but comparing it directly to another coat was shocking. Customer Service told me to send it to the warranty center. I did this - at a cost of $55 - and they’ve replied to say there is no problem. I’ve exchanged multiple emails and each is more and more unhelpful. I asked to escalate my complaint and again was met by only passive aggressive responses. Why on earth would I risk damage sending my coat - not to mention the cost - if there was no problem. I’m honestly disappointed and disgusted. To make matters worse, I wrote a review explaining this on the Canada Goose website, only to receive an email saying it wouldn’t be posted. Clearly only good reviews get posted. Honestly I’ve never been so disappointed in a company in my life!","July 28, 2022"
"Ricardo","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Purchased a Canada goose jacket about 5 years ago and it has faded terribly around the button, sew lines and cuffs. Some areas are worst then others. I would wear this coat on cooler days -30 and over. Probably around 3-5 times a year. This Jacket cost me over $1000 as you all are aware of. Lets get to the point and you decide if you will purchase a coat from them.I emailed Canada Goose and sent it in for a review. The reply I got was ""normal equal fading"". It may be normal for them, but this is not equal fading. Noone is blind, the areas I mentioned earlier really stand out in the daytime. They did nothing to warranty it, repair it, or even a suggestion. The parts that bother me is I have Helly Hansen, Under Armour, Dkny and numerous other jackets for the same time frame as the canada Goose and none of them have this issue. The under armour has been snowboarding numerous times and taken quite a few falls and is in perfect condition still. Especially NO FADING!Helly Hansen is clean and as new as day one, used it to hike and so forth. NO FADING!Other jackets I use for motorcycle and outdoor activities that are used many more days in a year  are in way better condition. These jackets ranged from $150-$700So this only tells me that Canada Goose has inferior product and sells it for a hi profit! If this is what you are looking for then I am happy for you, but I will never purchase anything else from them! Horrible product and dishonest to the clients, treat them as they are blind. Oh wait, they mentioned they put it under special lighting to check for equal fading. Let me tell you something, not sure if they walk around with this special light on day to day bases but I have never in my 40 years of life seen people walk around with a light over them. Unless they were modeling clothes.","June 14, 2022"
"r harris","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Another one star review to add to the many others on Trustpilot. I bought my wife a gaberdine style black coat in 2019. Last year we noticed rubbing and discolouration around the edges in places where you would not expect a coat to be rubbed.  It's particularly prevalent around the seams. So we now have a black coat with white marks The response from CG is that the coat contains 15% cotton which is a natural product and will discolour over time. What they mean is that the dying process is inadequate. If they know something will discolour, CG should take steps to prevent it happening. They haven't. They're trading on their name for making a warm coat, which it is.  But they're clearly cutting corners to save money. If you want a warm coat buy CG but be under no illusions that they're a poor outfit to deal with if you're unhappy.Update - 26 March 2024.This review has been up for almost two years and CG have just replied.

I’d recommend anyone trying to recover funds to open disputes with your banks and credit cards companies ASAP. You can only do this up to 60 days for some credit cards companies.

I also contacted Canada goose multiple times to several different colleagues on the phone and some of them were telling me different answers of why my Gillet wasn’t refunded and didn’t arrive. I figured that the reason they weren’t sure was because they are working from home ,not in the Canada goose headquarters so they were just making things up on the spot.However, the popular response was that there is an error in the system which sounds like a bunch of rubbish. We are now in February and my order still hasn’t been refunded yet. What’s worse is that I didn’t receive a single email or call about my order not arriving or about the “error in the system” for the refund .You would expect a multi-national company like Canada goose that sell expensive luxury products to provide decent customer service.

"VIV LIV","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-3.svg","My review is to update the dissatisfied customer who purchased a Canada Goose at Tyson's Corner II. Canada Goose "" Canadian Company""  FYI was bought out by US stake holders back in 2013. -- While still made in Canada, it is over 70% US owned as of 2013. Canada sold it out to the US.  See below:In December 2013, Boston-based private equity firm Bain Capital acquired a 70% equity stake in Canada Goose at a $250 million valuation.Bain Capital, a private-equity firm co-founded by the Republicans’ losing 2012 presidential candidate (he left the company in 2002 to pursue his political career), is buying a majority stake in Canada Goose, the Toronto-based maker of ubiquitous, puffy winter jackets. Bain’s success at wringing profits from the companies it acquires has been mixed. Even so, it’s unlikely that the coat-buying public will notice much of a difference in the short term. The Post is reporting that Dani Reiss, Canada Goose’s heir and CEO, will remain in charge.It was a great company with cheaper warmer winter coats that were actually worth the buy prior to its sale and now huge status symbol!

To make it clear Canada Goose didn’t do anything in regards to my refund. PayPal needed only 3 days to review everything and dispute the transaction.. Canada goose needed 5 weeks and no answer.Good I didn’t wait longer to dispute this transaction because after 60 days I wouldn’t  be able to do it and it would cost me over 1,3k. I will never buy anything from Canada Goose anymore. Adrianna","January 09, 2022"
"Mercy","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","January 9, 2022FRAUD BY CANADIAN COMPANY “Canada Goose”Canadian company “Canada Goose” operating also in Tysons II Mall in Vienna, VA, USA, has been engaging in what I consider to be a deliberate and blatant pattern of fraud as substantiated below:Order # CGUS_A01396076 placed in December 2021 with “Canada Goose” was not filled by that “Tyson’s II” mall company, claiming “item was out of stock” which is understandable, BUT THEY POCKETED THE FULL AMOUNT (around US$650) AND HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED TO REFUND IT despite numerous phone calls and in-person contacts. Numerous recorded phone calls to that company’s sole phone number shown in its online web page (888-2766297) got false promises to refund the fraudulently appropriated amount “within hours”. NO REFUND WAS EVER MADE. Employees contacted were:1.	“Andrew” on Jan 7 at 11am2.	“Jenique” on Jan 8 AT 9am,3.	“Canada Goose” store employees at its store in Tysons II Mall, Virginia, USA on Jan 6 at 12pm.The above “Canada Goose” employees repeatedly refused to connect me to their supervisor or to their finance department. I intend to publicize this fraudulent behavior to protect other US consumers from such fraudulent practices by this Canadian Company operating in the US. Time is of the essence.","January 09, 2022"

I made an order Christmas evening and I bought myself a Chilliwack Bomber, I received my order number and created my account up. A day later, I sign in to track my order and it seems apparently my account has no previous orders, I go to track my order and it says the email address or tracking number is incorrect. They are not, I’ve got screenshots on my phone to confirm they’ve given me that tracking number under my name and email address. So I go to contact them via email, I’ve sent out a total of 2 emails, no response back whatsoever. I’ve rang them 3 times and that’s just as bad. The first 2 times I explained my issue and they said they can’t find that order from their end, yet then money was took out my account (but that’s getting sorted as it’s now pending, but anyway), the first 2 people said they’ll get back to me and give me a call about an hour later, I’ve received no phone call and it’s been days later, I rang up again and someone said my case is already opened and apparently this is his words, this is a common mistake and my order is more likely to have been cancelled. What a joke this is, I pay the premium so I expect the bloody premium. I can’t say how frustrating this is. I wish I seen these bad reviews before ordering because I would of went else where like flannels and I would of had my coat by now. It’s like I’ve been scammed £975 and that’s a lot of money especially for me as I’m only 19 year old.","December 30, 2021"

I have called on their customer service line multiple times and was told to wait a few more days each time I called. They said they would have a supervisor call back but I have not received a callback and have gotten no updates about the refund being processed. I tried to contact via live chat and the same thing happened. The agent would apologize for the inconvenience but still take no action on the matter. They just keep delaying everything and say it will eventually get processed no matter how much I try to contact them. The lack of customer service. I have had a charge of 1411.55 on the card for weeks now for a product that was in hand for an hour. What a disgusting company. It is stressful to have that much money out of your bank account and they hold people’s money hostage and never respond. Hard-earned money that they do not reassure will come back and money that makes it seem like they are stealing from you. I am at a loss for words and have nowhere to turn to get the money back.

Additionally there was an external seam in the left sleeve that came undone. I took it to the approved dry cleaners (as per the Canada Goose website) and it would not remove it (i.e. it was not a stain). I did send the jacket in for warranty repair. While the customer service was nice and responsive, they repair hardly improved the fade. I do really like the style of the coat and is a great fit for someone petite. However, I am quite disappointed in the material quality. My brother purchased a Canada Goose coat from 5 years ago and it works great for the cold weather and there is no fabric fading. It must be the recent production of the coats which source poor quality fabrics as the dry cleaner also complained about this.","December 27, 2021"

The best they offer (after 20+ emails) is that, should I re-purchase my jacket, and need warranty help again, I should really use Fedex or another provider and they are sorry this warning was not on their site. From Google searches, it's clear I'm not the only one with this issue - but they appear determined to do nothing to either help me or help prevent this from happening to future customers.

They never delivered the parcel although they were adamant they had and said my wife had signed for the parcel (she hadn’t). All this was backed up with CCTV to prove. After a full week of going nowhere with DHL it turns out it was delivered 15 doors down from my house which was 23 not 53. More worrying the driver had forged my wife’s signature. The house up the road eventually delivered my parcel saying he forgot he had it?. Spoke with Canada goose about the whole ordeal. Who advised that they would compensate for our troubles. What we did not expect was what they compensated. I won’t mention what it was but WOW. Me and my wife were expecting maybe £10 off our purchase but it went far beyond that. By far the best customer experience I have ever witnessed from a company.","December 23, 2021"
"Lung M","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","My package got lost during shipping and it showed up as being delivered/picked up at a parcel point.I ordered my Limited edition Expedition Jacket at the 4th of December. I then got a message from DHL 7th of December at 1:36pm that they missed me and would reschedule the package for a later date. I was skeptical of this and checked my CCTV and I noticed nobody rang my bell and put a notice in my mailbox. I ran out and saw a DHL van outside and saw him putting something in his handheld device. I asked him  if he got my package and he said where's the package from I said it's from Canada Goose, which he responded no sorry I don't have such package. Annoyed I immediately called DHL to clarify the situation and they told me the package would be rescheduled to the next working day. I reluctantly agreed to it. Suddenly while on my call at 2:35pm I got a mail that my package could be picked up at a parcel point but the strange fact is that I requested it for the next day and the parcel point is 8km away from my house which is quite far.Not long after at 3:08pm my package got picked up by which is supposed to be ""me"" at the parcel point. I was really annoyed now and I immediately told DHL at the phone that my package was picked up by somebody else because I was still at home calling with DHL at that point. I also contacted Canada Goose Support through phone and e-mail to clarify my worries and provide them with the information that has occured to me. I spoke with Nadine and Yannick through the phone.Fast forward to 13th of December they said this was still in investigation and the package should have been picked up by me 100% because I was the only one that should've known the location of the package. I told Canada Goose that I want a proof of identification because I also requested a Proof of Delivery from DHL and the signature on the document was not mine. Hence I asked for a proof of Identification e.g. passport or ID. They told me they would put in the request and I should not call any further because I was calling every day to get an update. I am worried about my money because it's an 1500 euro jacket ofcourse I would call everyday. I also called DHL express again on 13th of December asking if I could have some more information on the case and they said the case has been already closed and the only instance that could open a case/claim was the seller in this instance Canada Goose. I also made a request of the notes to be send to my email so that I have all the notes on the case incase the investigation was not in my favour.I called everyday since then and on 21th of December I spoke with Yannick again and he told me that on 20th of December there was an update from DHL and the case has been closed in their favour because they are 100% sure my package has been picked up by myself. The request Proof of ID has not been listened to and I feel robbed of my money from DHL and Canada Goose. Canada Goose has since then told me they couldn't help me in any way and the only thing I could do is contact a legal advisor. Since then I have called with Geodis the logistics company,DHL and Canada Goose which they all refuse to help me on this matter. I am out of options.I also mentioned to Canada Goose that DHL was notoriously known for losing packages in my area and my neighbourhood has 400+ apartments which we all have a group app for so we could share information. almost 70% of the inhabitants have experienced problems with Canada Goose and DHL. I hope this review can make them understand that my issue has not been resolved yet and we can come to a conclusion.","December 21, 2021"

On my last call, 13 days after the return, someone asked if I’d gotten an email confirming they inspected the jacket. He said that normally happens within one to two days of their receipt of the returned item. Of course I didn’t get that. I don’t know what is happening and who I can escalate to. They keep saying they’re creating tickets but there has been no movement. This is abominable!!! I’ve never had to wait so long for a refund on a returned item. Across the board, no one takes more than a week. At two full weeks with no assuredness of when I’ll get my money back, Canada Goose is most certainly the worst retailer I’ve ever had dealings with. I’m disgusted and will never buy anything from them ever again. DEC 27 UPDATE: 9 days have passed since I left the above review so we are at THREE FULL WEEKS since the jacket I returned arrived back at Canada Goose. Again, I feel like someone has stolen my money. I called just now and the rep advised that she would add another note to  my file. I don’t understand! I feel as though the company is hoping I’ll give up on the chase for my money, so that they can STEAL it!! I don’t want to feel this way but that is how the company appears to be operating.I will have to find a way to get my money back.

I thought that it being such a high end company that I would not have any issues with their customer service.  Was I wrong.  I have had the jacket for 2 weeks, and already I am having issues.  The right arm is totally off.  The logo is coming off.  I thought since the coat is only two weeks old I would be able to return it for a new one.  I called customer service, I was told I would have put in a warranty claim and ship the coat at my expense to their warranty department.  I found this insane.  I will never ever buy a anything from Canada Goose.","December 03, 2021"
"KG","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","So I ordered 2 jackets over at Canada Goose on-line site, the Simcoe Jacket and the Women's Chilliwack Bomber Holiday edition for an upcoming Ski trip. No issues with shipping and processing, everything was all smooth. I ordered the jackets with a comfortable leeway before my trip. I got to open the package around 4 days after it was delivered as I was at a work trip. The Simcoe jacket was fine, the issue I had was with the Chilliwack Bomber Holiday Edition as the Logo Patch was incorrect. It was not matching the correct logo patch (which was a silver one), instead it had the black label logo patch which was that for the men's variant. Tags on the jacket and even the sizing indicated it was the women's bomber.I e-mailed customer support right away, that was a Monday, for a replacement or exchange of the jacket as I will be leaving the Friday of that week. It was more than 24 hours and no response from the e-mail I sent. I decided to call their customer service line and I waited for more than 40 minutes to just get someone on the phone and the full conversation lasted less than 2 hours which was mostly me being placed on hold majority of the time as the agent struggled to get a supervisor to handle my case. I have informed them that the jacket was intended for a trip and going to a store is not an option for me as it is more than 2 hours drive to get to the nearest one. It's winter, the roads are bad plus I couldn't fit it around my work schedule (that's why I ordered on-line in the first place). All I needed from them is to assure that they will ship me and cover for express shipping to get me the right jacket in time for my trip. But the agent cannot help me and instead advised me to my disgust to just wear the jacket on my trip with the tags on and then do the return after. I told Him that it was the most outrageous advice I heard coming from a customer support. I reiterated it to him that it was a Ski trip and if I ended up staining the jacket then I would end up having to void my return eligibility and in no way will I go around wearing the jacket with the tags still on.I was like, how does a high end brand like Canada Goose train their support? They sell very expensive products and their customer service etiquette is by far the worst I have ever encountered. I ended that conversation by the agent promising me that a supervisor will call me in less than 24 hours. This was already on a Tuesday.I waited until Wednesday and still no call, so I called again. The same experience, waited for more than 30 mins and stayed on call for more than an hour with no solution whatsoever and promised that a supervisor who can make a decison on my case will call me within the day.As I am typing this and it is already Thursday evening and still no calls, I sent another follow-up e-mail and still no response even from the first e-mail sent last Monday. My trip is the next day and it seems customer support is not in the priority list of Canada Goose. They just want you to buy their expensive jackets and do not even bother extending any kind of service after. Lower brands would put them to shame in a mile. Just utterly disgusted and frustrating dealing with Canada Goose. Never Again!!Update:Yes, it’s true,I finally got a call from a supervisor 1 week after I contacted them with my concern. I was still at my trip and still am as of this writing. He explained that they were looking into the issue with the website with the patch being the wrong color(and mind you, up to now the same silver patch is still what’s advertised).I really liked the jacket but I didn’t appreciate how customer services handled the issue & the stress & anxiety it caused. I specifically highlighted that I am not a fan of the black logo etc. I even had to buy another jacket (moose knuckles) to use for the trip. So To cut the story short, I was promised a “gift gesture” to make up for it and that I will not be disappointed.Ended a the call in a good note & I was informed that they have received the “gift surprise” at my work place. I asked them to check & it was just a waffle mackey toque with the worst logo tag they could possibly give me. I mean, I just told them that I don’t like the black logo & that’s what they sent me. That’s what a loyal customer is worth to them, despite of the misrepresentation of the product being sold, the worst customer service experience & follow-up ever & the immense hassle & time wasted being in contact with them & at the end that’s all a customer is worth to them. You guys could atleast have sent the artic disc toque but No! They just don’t value customers enough. The product function was never the issue here, it was the misrepresentation of what you are advertising & the extremely poor customer service you have for a high end brand. I am still out here on my trip & tomorrow’s the end of the 30-day return eligibility! I’m so done dealing with you! The worst ever!","December 03, 2021"

"SL","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Worst customer service experience I have ever had! Canada goose is considered a luxury brand but their customer service agents don’t treat it as such. I bought two Canada goose jackets this year and returned one. Both were puffer jackets for $895. I love the whole experience of receiving a Canada goose jacket from purchasing it to receiving it…the jacket I am keeping did NOT come in the black Canada goose gift box, instead it was thrown in a brown shipping box sloppily (not even in a plastic wrap, just tossed into a brown box) and is not the CG standard. It’s a completely different experience opening the shipping box, taking out the black box and seeing everything nicely stored inside of it. I keep the black boxes and store my CG coats in them.The customer service agents I spoke to didn’t understand the experience and said they can request a box for me but it’s not guaranteed because it needs to be approved?! I paid for this box and there shouldn’t be a question as to whether or not I receive it. CG wants people to buy their high priced products but their customer service is worse than that of less expensive brands. If someone is spending over $500 on a coat you should want your customer service to be white glove. The one agent I talked to didn’t even know what the black box was abs kept telling me they would ship it in a black box….I had provided her my order number and explained I received my jacket but it was missing the black gift box. She didn’t even bother looking at my order to try to understand.As stupid as it sounds, for me…the black box is a part of the experience and I felt like I had bought a knock off version of this coat when I saw it thrown carelessly into a brown shipping box. Very disappointing from a luxury brand. Please send me the box that is included with my coat!","December 01, 2021"

"Jamil B","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I wish I would have read these reviews before trying to purchase a parka from the new flagship store at South Coast Plaza. First, I will say the customer service at the store is outstanding. My issue is with phone and online customer service. NOT the flagship store.  I bought a virtual gift card using PayPal which on their site indicates almost instant delivery. I placed the order. Got a confirmation about 20 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that got an email saying my virtual gift card was delivered. Problem is, it was not delivered. I called customer service, and unfortunately, while everyone is super nice, the representatives you speak to have absolutely zero power to help. When you ask for a supervisor, there is no way to speak to one. I had to wait while the customer service reps communicated through an internal chat with the supervisor. After they could not resolve the issue, they said they would create a ticket to escalate, and it will be resolves in 24 to 48 hours. So now I""m super upset! I can't speak to a supervisor. The money has been paid by PayPal to Canada Goose, but my instant virtual gift card is still no where to be found. But don't worry....we are escalating it.....but that takes 24 to 48 hours. Let's just say I was not okay with that. I called back two more times, and nothing could be done. They just kept apologizing and said I just have to wait. I then chatted with someone online who apologized, said he saw all the notes and promised me someone was working on it and hopefully I would have the card soon. I checked back on line to chat again, and the representative told me he could not find my order and I need to contact the financial institution 😂 It's is amazing that a ""luxury"" brand has the service of a thrift store. Then I was pissed and called an got a very nice gentleman in Canada. He promised me he would work on it and that hopefully in 2 to 3 hours I would have good news. Bottom line. It is now evening here, almost 12 hours since I purchased my INSTANT Virtual Gift card, and nothing......no gift card, but they have my money. It is insane that a company of this caliber has the most horrible customer service I have ever experienced. The fact that a supervisor will not even speak to you is insane. At this point, I just have to hope that this gets resolved tomorrow. I spent about 3 hours of my valuable time dealing with this today. To say I am upset is an understatement. Their products may be good, but if their customer service is this atrocious, is it worth supporting this company........Beware before you engage with Canada Goose.","November 09, 2021"

"Mehnaz Chaudhry","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I was hoping to speak to Canada Goose customer service manager, however after much miss communication, I have been left no choice than writing here. I am a Norwegian living in London; in Norway, we grow up wearing Canada goose jackets as they provide the best protection from the extreme cold. I have used it all my life and never had any compliments, I would not use any other brand. 5 years ago I bought a classic women’s parka Canada goose jacket form Oslo, Norway after my old one was much worn out. I took good care of it, there was no damage to the jacket and I took it to dry cleaners by the end of the winter each year and so the colour had faded somewhat but it did not bother me. In 2019, however I noticed that the jacket was starting to loose it’s feathers; my clothes were getting damaged (under the jacket) by feathers that got stuck to the garment  and it was no longer as warm as it’s supposed to be. However due to coronavirus, I waited until summer 2021 when I took the jacket to Canada Goose on Regent street and they shipped it for inspection on June 5th. On 14th of June, I received the following email:  CASE 00158032 ‘We have recently completed the inspection of your garment! The defect is covered under warranty and cannot be repaired. As we would like you to stay warm in a Canada Goose we would like to send a brand new coat to you.’I was overjoyed when I received this email and I was so pleased that I always invested in Canada Goose as I thought they had good customer service. However, to my shock and horror I received another email on 15th June stating: “We are sorry to say that, due to a system error, you were sent an incorrect email” and it went on to say that I could not get a new jacket due to fading of the colour. It concluded with sending me either a scarf or beanie as good will gift. I wrote back regarding my disappointment with their miscommunication and demanded to speak with customer services. I spoke with someone who kept insisting that they could not replace my jacket due to fading of colour and I had to say to her over and over again that I sent it in due to loss of feathers not fading. She did not seem convinced and said that she would have it inspected again.On 17th June I received the following answer: ‘Our experts have seen that the down seepage is within quality standards considering the age of the garment. Please be advised that your jacket has reached the limit of its natural life cycle’.As expected, I realised that Canada Goose were not going to replace the jacket although it was a manufacturing mistake when the jacket started to loose its feathers, not the limit of natural life cycle. As mentioned, I had owned Canada Goose jackets most of my life and never experienced any problems. I always bought them because they promised lifetime guaranteed. I understand that if the jacket has been used roughly then the company cannot replace it, but I took really good care of my jacket and there was no damage to it. Following this I asked to speak to a manager and gave them some times to call around my work schedule. However, the customer service kept calling me at the wrong time, while I was working (I can’t pick up my phone while I am in consultation with my patients). I believe they were calling from another country and did not take U.K. times into consideration. After several missed calls and my busy schedule, I gave up and became extremely busy before leaving for a holiday. During this time, Canada Goose decided to send my old jacket back to me and unfortunately, due to my travelling, I did not see their emails until I received a text message from the delivery company about having left my over £1000 jacket outside my flat on the street!!! I contacted my neighbour and asked her to bring it inside when she gets home from work. I know it was my fault that I did not reply to the email when they told me that they were shipping the jacket back to me, but why leave it on the street??? Luckily, my neighbour rushed home and the jacket did not get stolen. I have been left absolutely devastated with the way Canada Goose has treated their loyal customer and I am no longer purchasing from them; I am no longer sure which brand I should wear in the winter. What has hurt me the most is how they first sent me an email saying that they will give me a new jacket and a day later changed their tone and focused only on the fading of colour not the actual manufacture fault. I have completely lost my trust in the brand and I am absolutely devastated.","October 29, 2021"

"X X","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Canada Goose's sales strategy.Guarantee.At first glance, the lifetime warranty offered by Canada Goose seems to inspire great confidence in the quality of their clothing. This way they can bind you faster as their customer.Common ailments.Anyone who has known the brand knows its flaws. The jackets, for example, are of very poor quality, apart from being nice and warm. In no time you can see cracks at the seams, discoloration of the buttons and zipper as if they can't stand rain and we are still silent about the discoloration in certain places of the jacket.If that happens I will send it in for repair and everything will be solved under the lifetime warranty?This is what they are waiting for at Canada Goose too. Besides that you will lose your item of clothing for a longer period of time, they will:- Stitch the cracks for you.- They don't do anything with the discoloration on buttons and zipper.- They do have a smart solution for discoloration in certain areas of the jacket. They will wash the coat in such a way that the discolorations will no longer be noticeable, because now the coat is completely discolored.Your fairly new (1 or 2 year old) garment will be washed in such a way that it will discolor all and be much duller than ever. Because the entire color of your garment has changed, you will not immediately notice this at first glance. Unfortunately, you also cannot immediately compare the current color of the washed jacket with the color of the jacket when it was sent to the repair center of Canada Goose.How can we sometimes recognize the loss of color after returning?The only possible way to make a comparison is to open the folded places.Asking for an explanation about the discoloration of the jacket.If you paid attention to your garment when you received it and you immediately noticed the discoloration, you will ask Canada Goose for an explanation. There is a great chance that you will receive the following response from them: “The washing has been carried out in a very professional manner, whereby the real condition / color of your garment has come up.” When you refute this with photos and evidence, they will indicate that it is not discoloration but dirt by own doing. The blame is placed on you almost immediately.If the discoloration is not immediately noticeable, what can and will I do?After wearing it again for a while and comparing it to other jackets, you probably start to notice that the color of your jacket has become dull. You will assume that your garment has had its best days.Probably you will go to the store for a new jacket and fill the pockets of the brand (Canada Goose) again that will offer you the so-called lifetime warranty.Do you still want to become a customer? You decide that yourself, but forewarned counts for two.With the warmest regards,Canada Goose Customer(s).","October 18, 2021"

I originally went to the store and was turned away very quickly by a rude worker, saying there was nothing they could do. As I left the store I decided I wasn’t okay with that, so I went back in and was determined to get a better answer. He then told me that they would send it off to the warranty place in Colorado(I think), to be assessed. I had to pay a dry cleaning fee which wasn’t too bad.

This wouldn’t have been an issue if they had replaced it with something just as nice or better, but they gave me a horrible, mangly, uneven fur that looked like it was 2 strips put together. I never asked for my original fur to be changed, which was a beautiful golden colour, look well trimed and complimented my tan jacket perfectly. For some reason, which the manager K. B. himself couldn’t explain, someone from the warranty team took my fur and put a poor quality one in place of it. The jacket is literally ruined now as I don’t even want to wear it now with such a hideous thing on the hood. Very disappointing and frustrating.I called the warranty team as soon as the jacket was shipped back to me from the cleaning to try to get the issue resolved. I expected Canada Goose to accept shipment of the jacket with no cost to me and to change the fur to a satisfactory one, representative of quality and price of the jacket, and send it back to me, simple. The warranty manager, kept dragging it on, saying the warranty team said my original fur was “maided” which is not even a word in English which he had to explain to me meant that the fur was worn out from rain and weather – despite me not having any issues with it or asking them to change it. He initially said he would escalate the issue and get back to me after 1 or 2 days, he never did, I had to call him back for the third time, where once again he told me that the warranty team did nothing wrong despite doing something I never asked them to and as a result giving me a poor quality product. I asked him to let me speak with his manager or someone higher than him to which he said there was no one, which is funny because to whom did he escalate the issue? As well, speaking with the customer service rep before being transferred to him, she told me that she saw notes in the system that he had called me back and spoke to me on a day that he didn’t. He didn't follow up with me or keep his promise. His solution was for me to ship back the jacket which I would have to pay for, which I already did when shipping it for cleaning, then I would have to pay $175 or more for a replacement fur. That's not a solution, that's a scam. When the warranty team caused the problem, did something I never asked them too and then charge you to fix the problem they caused when all I wanted and paid for was a simple cleaning. That's a scam, that's thievery. Now I have no options left as the only source to file a complaint is through the warranty team which K.B. is the supervisor of and apparently there is no one to monitor or oversee the performance of his team and whether or not they are doing their job properly. Clearly Canada Goose needs structural reorganization. Searching for different avenues, I have come across numerous complaints from other customers as well about the warranty team on various different forums. It’s quite the shame as I loved my Goose jacket and was simply looking for a cleaning before putting it away to use next winter. Instead I’ve gone back and forth with them for a month, am very unhappy, have an useable jacket and will never consider a product from this company again and if you value good customer service after you buy a product, then you shouldn’t either.","June 26, 2021"

"Barbara","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","This company has THE WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I actually think they may be intentionally ripping off their customers. I ordered 3 jackets last November. I returned them in December and they only refunded me for 2. The first refund was timely but the second one took 2 1/2 months. The third jacket was never refunded. The email confirmation from Canada Goose of receipt of the package didn’t come until April. Meanwhile, UPS delivery confirmations indicate that they received the packages in a timely manner. Every time we called customer service, we were told it was under investigation. They said that there were processing glitches due to Covid. We tried to be patient because we understand that Covid slows things down. But then a couple weeks ago, they said that they could not locate the jacket in the warehouse and so they couldn’t issue a refund. I am astounded that they would take this stance. We cannot fathom how they would expect the customer to eat the cost of a jacket that they cannot locate.  It took them months to process the return. Something obviously went sideways on their end. The fact that it sat in the warehouse for months, it’s not surprising that it’s missing. It’s possible operating under Covid restrictions taxed their staff but that doesn’t justify their not issuing a refund. It is completely unfair to put that back on the customer. What’s worse is they took so long that now I’m outside the 120 day period in which I can dispute it with the credit card company. There must be a way to protect consumer rights which I will be investigating…I will never ever order from this company again.","May 20, 2021"

I made an return on Feb 12 for one of them and the package was delivered on Feb.19 based on tracking number. however the $1131.38 refund was not issued after almost a month. so I contact costumer services via email on Mar.5. the representative said they confirmed they receive my return package but my refund was delayed because all the “problems” they were undergoing.        So I waited for another month until April, I began to call the consumer services, I got different answers each time. At first the representative said my refund was issued but two weeks later, other  representative denied the whole things his colleague was saying  and told me my refund is still processing.         After another month until today May. 7th, the representative told me that their warehouse can’t locate my package so their “headquarters” decided to not gave me the refund back.         In conclusion, Canada goose confirmed they received my package on march via email, two months later said that they can’t locate my package and I am responsible for their mistake.  I can’t believe this will happen to Canada goose, a well known and popular brand, I am shocked that you played your costumer like a fraudulent company.

I would also be without my jacket for 2 months, in the middle of winter.2) I ordered something from their website (don't get me started on HOW it was shipped in the box).

I immediately called customer service & explained to them that this is not the Langford Parka that I purchased in 2019 and that this is the Chilliwack Bomber jacket that was purchased on January 10, 2021.

"Bobby S","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-2.svg","This was originally a much longer review with a timeline spanning 13 weeks / 90 days, but as the issue is now resolved I thought it best to remove those points.**This was originally a 1 star review. CE sent me a complementary scarf a few weeks ago to say ""sorry"" and I appreciate the gesture.***I purchased a new parka on 12/12/20 from the Canada Goose website and was shipped the incorrect order by fulfillment. Although I received the order very quickly, I was not able to exchange the item for the correct one due to the short lead time before the holiday (which is understandable). Over the span of 10 weeks,  I’d been promised dispatch of the correct item at least twice and (later) an immediate refund 7+ times. I was finally refunded $1300US after at least a dozen calls and emails.As a shareholder, Canadian, and owner of some other Canada Goose products… I’m extremely disappointed. I believe that they care about their customers, but it’s important to ensure every interaction – every single one – is a great one. Mistakes happen and more than anything I would have loved to just been engaged with. Strong customer service recovery creates loyal, happy customers.… especially when things go wrong. This should’ve been opportunity vs an outcome.My return item was finally located by the warehouse 60+ days after receipt and a refund was completed on 3/8/21. While I'm obviously happy that my refund finally happened, I feel it’s really important to address the following points of feedback because so many customers have similar stories:-	Customer Experience staff need to be better positioned to solve customer complaints: Although it’s difficult to say for sure without knowing, I constantly got the sense that front line folks on the phone didn’t have the ability to immediately address issues affecting the customer. While it’s true that these folks alone can’t be responsible for the myriad of ecomm and warehouse issues, they need to be positioned to immediately solve problems on behalf of the customer without needing to escalate and wait weeks for answers. In short, customers want an advocate… someone who will work for them and represent them. Every person I talked to was very courteous and professional, but If you claim to sell a premier product you need to roll out the red carpet. Let these folks do that.-	Training needs to be consistent: For the first 3 weeks after initiating the return, I was told something different every time by CE. Am I receiving the correct item? Do I need to exchange it? Am I getting a refund? Get the message right the first time.-	Streamline whatever is going on between Ecommerce and the Warehouse: This isn't totally uncommon but no customer should need to worry about how these two work together. If you return an item and tracking shows it as received, the onus is on the company to sort out a refund within the 2-3 day timeline they've stated.-	Communication needs to be vastly improved: Refund might take 8 weeks? Just say so and explain why. At least the customer is aware upfront that you cannot honor the 2-3 day refund timeline that's been previously stated.If you want to purchase a CG product, I strongly recommend you purchase via a respected Authorized Retailer. To date, while my issue was resolved, it's still one of the worst customer experiences I’ve had.","February 05, 2021"

"Sarah L","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I purchased the Expedition Parka in early November when it was starting to get to about -20C where I live here in Canada. It was a touch too big, so I followed CG's direction to return and then order a new product. Completed my part within one week, falling in line with all of CG's outlined requirements for returns. The facility received the return in November, and according to the return policy, refunds should be issued within a few days, and the balance should be back into the original account within 10 business days. I'm not here to regurgitate their return policy, but only to mention the facts, because it is February and I am still waiting for a refund! I've had to call the company now over 14 times to check in on the status, and am constantly brushed off, misinformed, and completely disregarded. Though they have confirmed that they received the jacket, Canada Goose is holding over CAD$1500 that should have been returned back in December, yet it still has not been issued and no customer service rep will provide a reason. It has been the most frustrating, stressful, and degrading customer experience. I have absolutely no faith that I will receive my refund for a product that I abided by all the return guidelines. Canada Goose is a company that will outline high expectations from their customers, yet not hold themselves to same standard. If we denegrate this experience to a simple sentence: Canada Goose has robbed me. I really can't underestimate them more - and I truly don't think there could be a worse experience.  So, if you are ordering from this company that has no respect for their customers, I suggest you get the sizing right, otherwise you're going to be essentially giving donations to a multi million dollar company - which I'm sure you have the extra funds to do so.If you want a review of the coat that I purchased the second time, thinking I’d be refunded for the return.. fits fine, warm enough for -35, but, in the words of Missy, is it worth it? Can I work it? Can I put my thing down flip it and reverse it? I would certainly reverse this experience if I could. Never purchasing a CG product ever again.","February 04, 2021"

"Anita","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Paid the most I ever paid for a coat (hybridge knit hooded jacket).  Advertised lifetime warranty. (Lifetime ends when you cut the tags off, by the way).  Zipper was defective day one. Thought it might be me, so tried again with same problem and got stuck in it and had to pull coat off over my head!  Only got to wear to trunk pick up of groceries due to being 70 and Covid everywhere. Bought this as a present to myself for making it to 70 and it looked less bulky than most. Called to set up repair with Canada Goose and they said not covered. Beware....has the word knit in the name and knit not covered. And they noted it was made in Romania and they weren’t sure they could repair it if I sent it back at my expense and paid for the repair. What does knit and Romania have to do with zipper repair? Maybe I should try to contact Romania Goose?  I tried to post this on Canadian Goose and it kicked me off twice.  After I finished it said,”website not available, try again later”. Seems they only let good reviews go through. I’m afraid to send it back now after reading others seemed to disappear in the mail.  They couldn’t even promise they could repair it if it arrived to them. Just wondering how many more had zipper trouble and are out $700-$800? Would give zero stars.","January 25, 2021"

Being Canada gooses' sizes tend to run small due to their advertised ""slim fit"" design, I wanted to exchange for an XL and customer service told my sister it was non exchangeable due to it being over the 30 day timeframe. Also, there is pulls in the seaming of the jacket; In my opinion, I will not purchase one of these ""high end jackets"" due to their poor customer service, bad exchange policy of only 30 days AND we are in a pandemic so one would think they could extend that a bit or exchange a like-for-like being the jackets has never been worn AND was a gift!?

My item was returned and already reached their Netherlands warehouse the following day. Still, Customer service would not refund me after a month because 'my item had not been scanned yet'. Not my problem if they cannot have some order in their own house! I kept calling several times a week and was always told the same thing: either to wait for my item being scanned or for them to call me back for an update. Both never happened and I demanded to talk to their manager or finance department. Not possible, they told me. So I would not hang up the phone and demanded their manager calls me back on the same day. When he/she did not at the time we had agreed, I called again and after a few hours the manager called me to update me that they would reimburse me.This should not be like that, as customers willing to pay so much, we should not have to spend days calling them and for them not being able to fix anything. I had to shout (but still be respectful) and demand being called by their manager. My tip is to be extremely persistent to the point of 'annoying' them.

"Dina Baras","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Poor quality and TERRIBLE warranty.I sent in a trillium parka at the beginning of Dec. 2019 for a warranty claim because the jacket was falling apart. It was very lightly worn but the seams on the sleeves and pockets were fraying and splitting, the jacket was also starting to discolor.Super disappointing for a brand that is meant to be perceived as a luxury utility brand. I have had a number of more affordable coats from other companies like Helly Hanson and North Face that have lasted me 10+ years and still look new.It took them 2 months to assess my coat. The jacket they sent back was simply NOT the same quality. The fit was awkward. I wore it to the local CG store and a sales associate even commented on it. The sleeves also let in cold air in -6 Celsius When I resubmitted my claim in February 2020 and let them know, the warranty team gave me a canned response basically saying that my personal cold tolerance was to blame and the coat was just fine.I replied asking to escalate the issue. When a member of their own team says the jacket looks weird, that says something. The trillium parka is also rated for -25 Celsius, and I had worn my previous jacket in -40 without issue. They were consistently delayed in communicating to me and did not let me know when they closed their warranty facilities due to COVID-19. Since April, I personally had to follow up 3 times to get a status update with their social media team since no one was able to reply to me from their warranty team.My last interaction with their social team was last week. At that point I STILL didn’t have a jacket or a solution, and was just getting canned replies about how they care so much about their customer experience. When have you ever initiated a warranty claim that lasts for 9 months and still have not had a reasonable response? Any other clothing or coat manufacturer will just take back their item and replace with a new one in store. By the time of my last interaction, their stores were already open for business for many weeks. I suggested they should just send a replacement from the store since they are obviously operational.I got no reply. A couple of days later I got a shipping notification from the supposedly “closed” warehouse. They just sent back my faulty jacket with no context and had not looked into my feedback about the construction of the garment. I’m so disappointed with this experience. I’ve called their customer service team for a last ditch effort to get a reasonable exchange for my garment and will update this review based on what I hear back.","July 24, 2020"

"Rose Lee","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I sent my Canada Goose parka in for warranty as the colour is fading around the seams and the fabric around the arms is ripped.

I owned many jackets from other reputable designers like Moose Knuckle, Mackage, North Face and none of them have the problem with the color around the seams fading.  I expressed my concerns with the Canada Goose customer service and warranty department and they seem to dismiss my concerns and offered to repair it.    I also expressed my concerns about having multiple people handling the jacket and sending this back to me without being dry cleaned during this pandemic.  I emailed them asking for an exception to replacing this instead, and even under these circumstances, they still won't do it.   WOW, I am extremely disappointed with how they are still sticking to their repair under these circumstances, and having the customer wait for an unknown period of time.  You would think that with Covid in mind, they wouldn't want their customers receive back a jacket handled by many individuals. Just to be safe, I guess I can spend another 100 dollars to dry clean this again!!!  Why do you advertise lifetime warranty if there are so many hidden rules?  The fabric fading under the arms and at the back areas is definitely not wear and tear as no other designer coats I owned have this problem.Anyways this is the last time I will buy from Canada goose, this is my third jacket and the other 2 doesn't have this problem.

UNBELIEVABLE. It's not like CG would have to pay the reimbursement cost - that is on Fedex. The simply don't care at all about their customers. BUYER BEWARE WITH CG. Before you buy anything from them, PLEASE research their CS. I sincerely wish I had. Absolutely abysmal and without a doubt the worst I have ever dealt with. The best advice I can give is take your money and spend it at a less morally reprehensible company than CG. And the whole ""direct signature required"" thing?

"Andrew Glenesk","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I am extremely disappointed in this brand/company.  I liked my jacket up until my zipper broke and I sent my jacket in to be fixed under warranty.I went to their soho location store since I live in NYC and figured I'd have it fixed through the store rather than following the process on my own through their website.The sales associate studied and checked through my jacket.  She mentioned to me, ""They will clean your jacket is that okay"" . I said "" Yes Sure"" (I mean why would I care if they cleaned it.) . About a week and a half later I received an e-mail notice to login to see the status of my jacket.  They gave me an invoice for $110.  $35 for a cleaning and they wanted to charge me $75 to replace the right sleeve.  NOTHING was wrong with the sleeve when I turned it in.  I only requested that the zipper was broken.  The zipper was covered and they weren't charging me for the zipper, but the cleaning was not covered.  They told me okay they won't replace the right sleeve.  They said they found a snag but not a whole.  What does this mean?  The sales person checked over my jacket and didn't see this ""snag"" nor did I ever see it.  Otherwise I would have suggested it to the sales person as well to see if it can be fixed under warranty.  This makes me think either their cleaning ""snagged"" my jacket or it got ""snagged"" in transit or at the soho store.  If your jacket zipper is under warranty why should the consumer have to pay for the cleaning to which the hardware on their product was defected?  I asked to speak to a supervisor and the customer service guy told me it would take 24 hours for me to speak to a supervisor.  I asked, ""You don't have a manager or supervisor on staff right now?""  He said, ""NO""This was a terrible experience after spending a larger amount of money on a product expected to be good as well as customer service being helpful it all ended up feeling like a scam.In Store Sales Associates should be trained better to let customers understand certain costs are involved.

They tell me to come in store to send off the Parka for a warranty claim. When I get there they tell me it is a requirement to get the Parka dry cleaned before sending it off to warranty. I highlighted the ridiculous customer experience in store to no avail. I called customer services and same answer. I requested to speak to the manager, but was told that manager will say exactly the same thing and there is no point escalating it. Upon persisting with my request, there was no manager on the shift apparently to speak to.

Unlike what Canada Goose claims, the company uses cheap non-durable fabrics. The materials they use are worse than North Face and not even a comparison to Moncler. The parka got ripped on one sleeve (about 3 inches) from a hanger so easily. This never happened to any other clothes before. Sent to Canada Goose for repairs and guess what I received? This standard rejection email (it doesn't even have the writer's name):************************************************ We hope this email finds you well. Our Quality Assurance team has performed a thorough inspection of your product. The issues found with your jacket are deemed as normal wear and tear for products of this age, and are not covered under Canada Goose's warranty. In cases where we are unable to make a repair under warranty, we will often offer repairs for a nominal fee, however in the case of your coat we are unable to match that shade of cloth from our repair inventory. Canada Goose certainly has the fabric that was used to make your jacket, however the hard part is color matching the fabric that we have with your jacket in its current state. When a fabric is exposed to the elements and has gone through multiple wash or dry clean cycles, it is expected to change from its original color, so getting the exact shade becomes increasingly difficult and sometimes impossible. We understand that this was not the result you expected, and we want you to know that our warranty team thoroughly inspected your jacket before reaching the decision that it could not be repaired without causing further damage to your jacket. We will be returning your jacket to you, at our expense, within the next 10 days or upon your reply.Warmest regards,Canada Goose Warranty Team******************************************************* That is what Canada Goose calls the lifetime warranty and repairs. Oh, and so far the whole process of nothing took 1+ month and no parka was returned back to me yet. What a lame. If you have Canada Goose, have the department store where you purchased the jacket be the first contact point for return/exchange/repairs. Department stores honor their loyal customers and Canada Goose will not be able to treat them like they treat consumers.","December 06, 2019"

It did not fit, so I wanted to exchange it for the next size up.I went after 2 weeks to the store they told me there’s sings of use on it and we cannot exchange it with a bigger size, and I only used it for one week it turned out when it’s so cold and I want to wear more clothes I cannot close the zipper how can I survive the winter with it???I sent them an email, They told me I have to send another email for Quebec branches what????? Isn’t supposed to be your job to forward it ?? Anyway I sent them another email to Quebec branches in Montreal, I didn’t receive any reply. I called the customer service and I told them the whole story and they told me they are sorry they cannot do anything because 30 days of warranty have been passed and we cannot exchange it. It’s not my fault if I went to your store and they didn’t accept to exchange it, it’s my worst experience EVER. I considered as my top brand but now I don’t want to walk in that store again.

"Robert","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I originally bought a grey MacMillan Parka 2 years ago and a year and minimal wear I noticed white marks under armpits on the external material. I contacted the warranty team at Canada goose about it and they said to send the jacket in. After inspection they said the material was faulty and the white marks shown were undue wear and tear for the jackets age and sent me a replacement, this time in black. That was ten months ago and fast forward to today and I have the same issue with white marks under the armpits. I again contacted them a month ago and sent the jacket in. I received a very vague email regarding some repairs they were carrying out, which included replacing both cuffs, restitching certain areas and colour fast treatment. I received the jacket back and the white marks were still under the armpits. I contacted them and they said that the jacket is not faulty and the white marks are due to wear and tear, a totally different story to my last jacket where they accepted the issue without fuss. Apparently the jacket is fully functioning and it is not an aesthetic jacket, made solely for cold weather and therefore white marks are not an issue. For a £800 coat....not meant to look good for more than 6 months.....who are they trying to kid. It is like your paint peeling off your year old car and the manufacturer saying that as it still drives and is safe it is not an issue!! Add to that the fact the jacket needed multiple repairs I hadn't even known needed doing makes you seriously question the quality of the jackets. Their stance is firm, there is no escalation process other than speaking to a manager. Shocking customer service. I for one will not be buying another of Canada goose jacket, will be strongly suggesting any friends, family or readers of this review do not unless of course you want to spend a lot of money on a coat that will look seriously worn after minor wear.","June 21, 2019"

"Keith","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I purchased a Hybridge jacket in red as a Christmas present for my wife. I mistakenly thought that Canada Goose were synonymous with quality, I was wrong. After my wife had worn the jacket a few times we started to notice that the the internal black fabric started showing through the outer red fabric making it look stained and dirty - not what you expect from a Canada Goose! I contacted Canada Goose approximately two months after I purchased the jacket and I sent it back to their warranty department for review. Unfortunately, their response was more than a little disappointing. According to Canada Goose this is what it’s designed to do. Quote from Canada Goose: “The fabric of the HyBridge Lite is thinner in order to make them lightweight. Due to the colour contrast of red and black, down underneath is visible and come off as slightly black, taking on the reflection of the black material inside. As the red material is lightweight you can also see the black material behind. What your wife is experiencing occurs because of the design of the coat and this does not represent a manufacturing defect.” Funny it doesn’t say on the website that this coat will look shabby and dirty after a couple of weeks!! I did try to publish this review with photographs of the jacket on their website. However, Canada Goose rejected it as it ""did not meet their website guidelines“ presumably the truth.

"Ruth Jeang","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Opened a case for my coat regarding dye fading after a season and a half of wear. Sent photos and descriptions, but it doesn't seem like anyone cared to look at them before sending some automated emails asking for me to to pay out of pocket for dry cleaning before sending, and to pay for the shipping of the coat for assessment. It's poor customer service to ask an already dissatisfied customer to go through this added headache and cost for what is supposed to be a premium product, without providing any prediction or insight into where the case may be headed. I was hoping the quality of the coat could make up for your failing brand image, but it seems like the quality matches the brand. Poor quality, poor customer service, poor branding. Nothing but a status symbol. The above was what I posted on Canada Goose's Facebook. I received a scripted reply asking for me to private message them to work something out. I was hoping for more of a personalized reply, some accountability and transparency. Ever thought that you could use it as an opportunity to put other customers at ease by being transparent with how the company handles complaints? Instead of focusing so much on expanding, how about worrying about the quality of your products and how it associates with your brand? How about expanding on locations for after-service if you can't seem to address the dwindling quality of your products? If you can't provide value in the coat, at least provide it in service. It's not a good look to have your customers walking around with under-stuffed and or faded coats. It doesn't look aesthetic and appealing to potential customers. Your customers are also your ambassadors, both directly and indirectly when they are out in public. With all this being said, I am not willing to pay for dry cleaning and shipping to have YOUR inferior product be assessed by you. Your product did not live up to the expectations that YOU have instilled in people. There's also the inconvenience of being without the coat after shipping it.  And who knows if i'll be left to foot the bill for repairs. I'd rather cut my losses short and never purchase Canada Goose again. I will be sure to warn others as well.","February 22, 2019"

Spoke to me like i was an annoying child being petty about a £5 jacket and he sounded completely bored of the conversation! 3 different operators told me 3 different options for me which wasted weeks of my time leaving me without a jacket in the middle of winter! I was offered no apologies or any sort of acknowledgment of the fact they completely messed me around and now i'm waiting 4 more days for my jacket to arrive. Never have I been so strongly dissatisfied with  a service and the way I was treated that I felt the need to write a review.","February 08, 2019"

I could feel the cold in the arms near the seams.  I noticed that the down insulation was lacking in this area.  I mentioned this to an employee in the Boston store and they recommended I immediately send the garment to Warranty which I did.  I was told a two week turn around and it took 58 days during which time I was given a canned response by customer service when I would call to check on the progress.  I finally received the garment back and was disappointed to see that the garment is still cold in the arms and it was not apparent that any down was actually added to the arms in the area of the seams.  It is only 36Degrees F.  I should not be cold in this garment.  I recommend another brand if you are considering this brand.  It's too bad.  It's a beautiful parka.  Just poor quality and poor customer service.","February 07, 2019"

"Marsha Jarvis","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-2.svg","Bought a CG coat approximately 7 years ago. Sent this Kensington model parka for warranty since it was no longer providing warmth.  The down in the sleeves was almost non existent.  The fabric had faded and there was some wear around the cuffs.  The fading and cuff wear were not big issue to me.  I did not expect any warranty to cover these issues since I consider this a part of normal wear and tear.  I did expect the company to do something about the fact the down did not stay in the coat and was now very cold to wear.  I sent the jacket off for warranty review asking about the warmth issue only.  The company notes they would stitch a couple of areas however they would not do anything about the down as it was considered normal wear and tear.  Stitching minor areas on the cuff should not be covered as that is actually normal wear but continued warmth of a product designed to keep you warm should be!  I am so disheartened with the 'warranty'.  On top of that, they insisted the coat needed dry cleaning.  I had only dry cleaned it in the spring prior to storing it for the summer and had just taken it out on the fall.  I had worn it twice until I decided it was just too cold to continue to wear.  To give potential customers an idea of how much down was missing from the sleeves... You could rub the arm of the jacket between your fingers and feel the fabric rub against fabric, you could not feel down.  We own 5 CG jackets within our family.  We will never purchase another.  Buyer beware...you did purchase much, much cheaper down coats to provide comparable warmth of the Kensington parka and replace it every couple of years... Do not think you are getting any value from the warranty.","January 18, 2019"

Even though in their return policy it is written that it should be unworn, but my point is how would I know without wearing a outwear that it will keep me warm enough? Such a fake condition of return!! I have experience of working in an international retail store so I have proper idea about product management and return policy. However I went to the store to return it. They didn't even ask me the reason for the return (seems like they don't care!!). They just started doing the anatomy of the the product to say NO to return. they didn't give me any reason why it is not OK to take it back. They just told me it has been worn. I said yes I wore otherwise how would i know. I could have lied to them but i didn't. I should have called their manager. They seem like just not willing to accept any return request!!! I felt such offended that I felt like returning the item to the store without taking any refund from them!!!A brand cannot survive as a trustworthy one if they do not care about customer satisfaction.

They send you regular emails and refer to the tracking sight. If your late in correspondence they start dropping the procedures. They ship back the wrong size, then its impossible to swap for the right size without going through the whole procedure again. Weeks turn into months and there is no communication between the repair unit and sales and customer service.  The coat, started fading, seams popped looking shabby inside a year. This time tried the store return approach. Manager was very understanding and shipped the coat to CG. They could not find it between US and Canada repair areas. Store manager gave up retuning my calls for an update after 3 weeks. From the warranty  department finally got the word the coat is no longer available and would I accept a substitute? Confirmed acceptable terms to come to the store and select the exchange.

This includes their promise to use only ""wild"" fur, never farmed, as if this is somehow ethically better in some way.*As PETA has found in investigating whether the trappers and suppliers that Canada Goose uses are following the ""humane standards"" as pledged (which include checking all traps DAILY), the only part of ""humane"" involved is that humans are committing the brutality and torture of these defenseless animals.Coyotes are caught in no-kill traps for days if not weeks to slowly die of starvation, thirst, frostbite, predation, and blood loss. Some mothers will struggle violently, even trying to bite off their own paw, to return to their pups, who starve and die without them. The treatment of the geese in the stripping of their bodies for down is just as gruesome.PLEASE don't spend your hard-earned money on these overpriced blood-drenched excuses for outerwear. There are so many truly humane alternatives in this world. Let's not allow cruelty to win. * The fur industry would have you believe that they're performing a vital service to the natural world by ""culling"" these ""nuisance"" surplus coyotes and geese and making sure the bodies don't go to waste. It's clearly a lot of self-serving PR. If trappers truly would follow humane standards like checking traps daily to prevent needless suffering it wouldn't be as egregious ( still completely unacceptable) but none do!","December 14, 2018"

The biggest issue was the length of time it took and the slow communications.  The company did replace my item, it just took almost 3 months.  Glad i had other options.  The support rep's were pleasant and knowledgeable and generally very helpful.  The process seemed to be just flawed at best.  First you setup a warranty return case online and ship the item in for inspection.  UPS delivered the item n 5 days but the web site was not updated for 4 weeks after that.  So we are already at 5 weeks.  Finally, the item was ""found"" and listed as arrived.  It took roughly 3 more weeks to be inspected.  Return shipping must have been by mule train as it took another 3 weeks from Ontario to Boston.  Retailers who handle the garments warned me of exactly this.  The warranty was upheld, the item replaced but why does it take them so long!!?I think better and cheaper gear can be bought from RAB, Arcteryx etc.  Those two companies have been extremely good with their customer support.","March 22, 2018"

My intention was to go to the new Regent Street store, try it on, look at a few other coats, enjoy the shopping experience, etc. I phoned them to check stock first. ‘We don’t know what we have in store’. ‘Well please go and check’. ‘I can’t leave my desk otherwise no-one will answer the phone’. ‘Mmm, what’s the point in answering the phone if you can’t help your customers’. ‘OK, can I reserve one or make payment over the phone, if you had one?’ ‘No’. ‘OK so I have to spend £50 on a train fare and a 4 hour return journey just to find out if you have one at Regent Street?’ ‘Yes’. ‘What happens if the last one is sold 5 mins before I arrive?’ ‘There’s nothing I can do about that’.So I bought 2 different colours from CG online and returned one (the reason I bought two was that when I emailed CG customer services in Canada two pictures of my colour preference taken from the internet but which showed different shades so I could clarify which was correct, they didn’t know and couldn’t/wouldn’t find out). When the jackets arrived, the down fill on both was noticeably less than the Selkirk. I spoke to the Regent Street store manager on his mobile. No problem, we will replace it. Excellent. When? I don’t know (the colour Admiral Blue in M went out of stock end Dec 2017 and this was now early January 2018). Website has stated ‘back in stock soon’ for 2 months. ‘What is ‘soon’? Don’t worry, the replacement offer is for life. OK so I send the manager 3 emails in Jan and Feb asking him to confirm this offer in writing. No response. I phone his mobile number, which he has answered previously, 3 times last week and this week. Answer message. I phone the Regent Street number – but now diverted to the Netherlands. I ask that they pass him a message to call me. We can’t do that. After persisting, OK we’ll take your email address and someone will email you. No email. I ask the same thing a week later. No email. Clearly the manager, if he is still there, has been told not to answer emails, telephone calls, etc.I need to buy my wife a winter coat and I can guarantee it will not be a CG one, probably a Froccella or Pyrenex.But why would CG worry about customer service. Their products are much in demand. They deliberately starve supply to try to increase that demand. Their customer service is the worst in the business. If you know what you want and don’t care about back-up, go ahead and take a chance. But do read these reviews, it’s not a co-incidence that they get 1* for 15 out of 16 reviews, and be prepared for a truly shocking customer experience if you ask them to go the extra mile because you need help. I should add I have nothing to do with the animal rights lot.","February 27, 2018"

I called Canada Goose regarding my online purchase. Probably my english was not as fluent. But the way how they talk and yelling back at me. I have never experience anything like this. I even talk to the manager too. The manager was super rude. I order two jackets online and i received them. But i realize that both jacket does not have the exterior logo. I called just to verified that does the jacket comes with the CG logo or not. cause I assume all the CG jacket comes with a CG logo on the should sleeves.Which they told me it doesn't come with it. so I said i saw it online at sporting life website. both jackets, it shows online it has a CG logo on the sleeve.I end up returning both of the jackets. Bad customer service.","February 01, 2018"
"jim","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I will never buy Canada Goose again !!  Terrible customer service !! I never received my order from them and all they say is oh well. Finally got my refund as they said the order was cancelled because of lack of inventory. While their site and customer service said there is inventory. Just terrible service. I will go out of my way to inform as many people and stores such as Moosejaw and Backcountry not to sell/buy their product.  Arcteryx is just as good if not better with better customer service.","January 30, 2018"
"Lauren Ansay","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Horrible experience with Canada Goose. I placed a $1300 order and paid for express shipping. I talked to a representative and they said it would ship the next day, called everyday subsequently because it hadn’t shipped and after almost a week THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER. (Which I found out by calling them, I was not notified by the company) They said that they never had the jacket to begin with and there was a glitch in their system. After a fruitless transaction, lots of frustration and time consuming phone calls I’m still jacketless. I’ll be buying a parka elsewhere.","January 10, 2018"
"Ashley","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Horrible customer service. I originally ordered a jacket for myself that cost $925 and didn’t receive an email confirmation back stating the order was placed but my cc was charged so after a couple days I called to find out if the order processed and if it had shipped. They told me that the order was processing still it sometimes may take up to 3 business days to process (crazy) so I said no worries I’ll call back if I don’t receive a shipment notification so Day 3 I call back and apparently it was still processing and I should receive some kind of correspondence by end of day. That next day (day 4) I ended up receiving my jacket. Still didn’t receive an email with an order number nor tracking but hey at least I got my coat. For the money I wasn’t crazy about the style so I figured I would return and purchase another style. I went to place another order but my cc declined the purchase bc of the amount $925 they wanted to confirm I was making that purchase so I confirmed with my cc company and tried placing the order again and it went through. This time I received and email confirming my order was placed however an hr later I received another email saying that my order was cancelled due to in quotes:“Unfortunately we were unable to verify the legitimacy of your payment information. “ Thinking this was a glitch since my cc did reach out to verify my purchase, I tried to purchase this coat AGAIN. Once again the order goes through saying it was placed and received an email again confirming. This time I think I’m in the clear so I go to bed. I wake up the next morning to the same exact INVAILD PAYMENT email so I end up giving their customer service a call to see if they can place the order for me and to express the troubles I had been having trying to placing this order. At this point all I want is my jacket and now I wake up to find the size color and style I want is now unavailable. Of course now I’m upset and have all these pending charges on my cc account. When I finally speak to customer service they tell me that my account has now been red flagged bc of the amount of times I tried to place this order. I’m like now even if I did want to place the order in a size down I couldn’t bc my account under my name has been red flagged. They told me to try again in 2-3 business days and they couldn’t do anything to override this. I hang up and order the coat under my boyfriends name number and debit card and the order goes through, I receive an email confirmation, and think this time I should be good. I ordered the jacket on Monday and received an email today FRIDAY that my order has been cancelled due to the size I requested is out of stock. Of course now I’m really upset. I go onto the website and see that the size I originally requested is now available again but only 2 sizes are left so I call customer service immediately and explain once again my frustrations, and ask to please change the order to my original size however they were unable to recover the cancellation and would need to place a new order. I explained that I had problems placing the order before but they told me 2-3 business days so he confimed the information with his manager and proceeded to place the order under my name and cc since I was at work. I requested express shipping at their expense since I had expected the coat soon. They said they would put the request in to “headquarters” and I would receive the $40 refund due to all my troubles. Again I just wanted to purchase this coat. I already had 2 pending transactions on my one cc. Another pending transaction from my original order awaiting the refund and my boyfriend also had a pending order on his cc. Totaling $3700 in pending transactions. He went to place the order and my order didnt go through. He tried it again and it didn’t go through but it went through to my CC bc it was showing up as an additional 2 transactions now totaling about $5600 in pending transactions. I ask to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor expresses that she “understands” my frustrations but there is nothing they can do. She offers to call the nyc flagship store and see if the coat is available but I had already told her that I went and the availability was scarce. I was disconnected from that call. I call back later that day to speak to a manager but they were not in the office but she will make sure someone calls me Monday. In the meantime I have my brother try placing the order for me online but this time in a different color since BLACK was completely unavailable at this point. Thinking to myself why do I continue to try.. but he places the order under his cc and received the same exact INVALID PAYMENT email I received  What do I do at this point. I’m so disgusted by this company and if it wasn’t for the quality I would have never attempted to purchase this item as many times as I’ve TRIED.","January 06, 2018"

Probably the worst customer service i have seen, you would expect at least a decent service when you purchase something that expensive.i will never buy from them again","November 30, 2017"

"Tamara Coche","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","I ordered a jacket that does not fit me so I wanted to send it back. I wrote to the customer service and asked for the return label. I received an email with a phone number to call them back. I tried to call but my call did not get through because I called from a different country. I wrote to the assistant and told her just to send the label. She said without phone number she could not send the label due to policy. But the terms do not say you have to leave the phone number so the DHL person could pick the parcel up. I told her it is much more convenient for me to drop it off at a post office (I checked with them earlier and it was ok). I still have no label. She send me the terms and conditions and hers are also not stating I need to send a phone number. The downside is: I cannot just send the jacket back because the terms state: they need a return label to handle it...Worst customer service in the WORLD! And I just want to return the jacket...","November 01, 2017"

"John Perkins","https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg","Abominable customer service.Their products may be amazing, they are certainly very expensive.  Sadly their customer service is truly appalling.  Here's my recent experience.  My wife ordered a jacket that, on arrival, was defective.  I called and then emailed them a photo.  Did they call back with options as they promised?  Hell no.  All I got was an email telling me to send it back and wait days for a refund.  I called back, spoke with several staff whose grasp of English and their foreign accent made it difficult to understand.  Their hands were tied.  In compensation i was promised a Canada Goose hat for my wife.  A week later it had not arrived.  The first person I spoke with told very clearly that sending the hat was dependent on them receiving back the faulty garment.  This was not made clear to me at the time so I insisted on speaking to the supervisor who had promised the hat.  He then told that sending the hat was NOT dependent on getting the jacket back.  He had ordered the hat that day and had no idea why it had not arrived and had no way of finding out why it had not been sent.  What a fiasco.  I then insisted on speaking to a manager, but there was none available for 2 hours (this was at 12 pm, so may be they take 2 hour lunch breaks.  I asked to get the manager to call me today. Will it happen.  Somehow, based on my experience so far, i am not holding my breath.  Advice.  if you want a Canada Goose jacket, do not buy it from Canada Goose.","April 07, 2017"
